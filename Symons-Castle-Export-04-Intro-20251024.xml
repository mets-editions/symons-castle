        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>

        <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">The fourteenth-century Middle English poem known as <hi
            rend="italic">The Castle of Love</hi> is a translation of an earlier poem, <hi
            rend="italic">Le chasteau d’amour</hi>, written in the first half of the thirteenth
          century by Robert Grosseteste (ca. 1168–1253) in Anglo-Norman, the dialect of French
          spoken in England.<note target="#1" type="footnotelink">1</note> Its status as a
          translation does not imply the Middle English poem is an inferior “copy” of a superior
          “original,” however. Every translation is necessarily an adaptation that reflects the
          interests and needs of its own translator and audience. The Middle English poem is a
          skillful translation close to the Anglo-Norman source that nevertheless manifests in its
          gaps and expansions, its restructurings and additions the interests of its own audiences
          and moment. The version of the poem preserved in the Vernon manuscript (Oxford, Bodleian
          Library, MS Eng. poet. a. 1), which forms the base text for the first 1514 lines of this
          edition, includes a brief incipit that identifies the work as “a tretys” called “<hi
            rend="italic">Castel of Love</hi>,” which “Bisschop Grosteyzt made.” This little
          introduction deploys Grosseteste’s name as if he were the direct author of this Middle
          English version; in contrast to many English translators’ prologues, the narrator does not
          admit the poem has been translated.<note target="#2" type="footnotelink">2</note> For the
          audiences who consumed this text, then, this was the original.</p>
        <p style="body" n="1">Grosseteste was an important English theologian, philosopher,
          scientist (natural philosopher), translator, and writer active in the first half of the
          thirteenth century.<note target="#3" type="footnotelink">3</note> Not much is known about
          his early life, but he was born in Stowe, Suffolk, and his family was poor.<note
            target="#4" type="footnotelink">4</note> He may have spoken English as his native
          language, or Anglo-Norman; in any case, he was fluent in both languages.<note target="#5"
            type="footnotelink">5</note> Although he came from a poor family, he was educated in
          theology (probably in Paris) and served as chancellor of Oxford (between ca. 1214 and
          1221), where he also taught theology.<note target="#6" type="footnotelink">6</note> He was
          a deacon by 1225, became archdeacon of Leicester in 1229, and began teaching the
          Franciscans at Oxford in 1229/30.<note target="#7" type="footnotelink">7</note> He was
          ordained bishop of Lincoln Cathedral in 1235 and died in October of 1253.<note target="#8"

          traditional views, his works came to the attention of John Wycliffe in the 1360s,<note
            target="#9" type="footnotelink">9</note> and they became embroiled in Wycliffite
          controversies in the fourteenth century because of Wycliffe’s admiration of them.<note
            target="#10" type="footnotelink">10</note> Like Grosseteste, Wycliffe was part of the
          clergy, as well as a philosopher and theologian who taught at Oxford University. Unlike
          Grosseteste, Wycliffe was also a reformer and dissenter — a kind of proto-Protestant —
          whose use of Grosseteste as an authority in his own writings was often at odds with the
          views Grosseteste himself espoused. As R. W. Southern explains, Wycliffe’s <hi
            rend="italic">Civil Lordship</hi> both makes “legitimate elaborations of Grosseteste’s
          argument” and implies “support for a further step which Grosseteste did not take,” a move
          made possible in part by Grosseteste’s own “open-ended methods of argument — his
          invitations to readers to make their own additions.”<note target="#11" type="footnotelink"
            >11</note> Jim Rhodes suggests this “open-ended” style particularly characterizes the
            <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>, whose “fictionality, that is, its use of poetic
          analogies and devices, encourages readers to interpret and evaluate events in their own
            way.”<note target="#12" type="footnotelink">12</note> Ultimately, the admiration
          Wycliffe and his followers the Lollards had for Grosseteste turned Grosseteste into a
          household name for the dissenters, as even less-well-read preachers made use of a
          repertoire of Grosseteste quotations to bolster their own rhetoric.<note target="#13"
            type="footnotelink">13</note> This popularity among the Wycliffites also led to the
          proliferation of copies of Grosseteste’s works in the fourteenth century and was probably
          responsible in some cases for a large number of surviving manuscripts.<note target="#14"
            type="footnotelink">14</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="3">Grosseteste was a prolific writer of vast breadth. Most of what he
          wrote was in Latin, but there are a few works in Anglo-Norman besides the <hi
            rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> attributed to him.<note target="#15" type="footnotelink"
            >15</note> He made important intellectual contributions in theology, philosophy, and
          science, and his output included commentaries on biblical and philosophical works;
          writings on scientific, philosophical, pastoral, and devotional topics; as well as
          translations from Greek.<note target="#16" type="footnotelink">16</note> As part of his
          investment in intellectual life and biblical exegesis, Grosseteste was committed to the
          importance of pastoral care, that is, the clergy’s responsibility to guide (and ultimately
          save the souls of) those in their care. Indeed, as Philippa M. Hoskin explains, “[b]y the
          time he became bishop of Lincoln, Grosseteste had a developed theory of pastoral care
          including its purpose, practice and effects.”<note target="#17" type="footnotelink"
            >17</note> Grosseteste saw pastoral care as something that not only helped save
          individuals but also “could bring about global salvation.”<note target="#18"
            type="footnotelink">18</note> Working toward the pastoral goal of communicating complex
          theological and philosophical concepts to lay or uneducated audiences, Grosseteste’s
          decision to write some works in Anglo-Norman helped achieve this aim.<note target="#19"
            type="footnotelink">19</note> Part of his project in the <hi rend="italic"
          >Chasteau</hi>, as professed in its opening section, is to reach readers who cannot read
          Latin, Greek, or Hebrew, an idea that the translator of the Middle English <hi
            rend="italic">Castle </hi><hi rend="italic">of Love</hi> extends to those who cannot
          read French (Anglo-Norman).<note target="#20" type="footnotelink">20</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="4">Both Anglo-Norman and Middle English versions of the poem were
          composed in octosyllabic rhyming couplets, although neither version is strict about the
          number of syllables.<note target="#21" type="footnotelink">21</note> The Middle English
          poem, like its Anglo-Norman precursor, deploys courtly poetry motifs, architectural
          imagery, legal concepts, and popular narrative techniques from oral storytelling to
          elucidate the poem’s central theme of Adam’s place in salvation history and humanity’s
          redemption. These aspects of the narrative are joined by the use of popular genres,
          including allegory and debate, the generic fluidity suggesting one reason for the poem’s
          popularity and influence on later medieval works. Grosseteste’s well-known and influential
          treatment of the allegory of the Four Daughters of God and the debate between Jesus and
          the Devil both employ the language of seisin (property ownership) and English law.<note
            target="#22" type="footnotelink">22</note> The allegory of the Virgin Mary as the Castle
          of Love who protects Jesus’s Incarnation is a rich tapestry of descriptive architectural
          features and their symbolism. These treatments of the theme of salvation resonated so
          strongly with later medieval writers that Grosseteste’s <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>
          influenced such works as the <hi rend="italic">Cursor Mundi</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Runner
            of the World</hi>], the <hi rend="italic">Gesta Romanorum</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Deeds
            of the Romans</hi>], and William Langland’s <hi rend="italic">Piers Plowman</hi>, among
          others; it also gave rise to three Middle English translations or adaptations, in addition
          to <hi rend="italic">The Castle of Love</hi> edited here.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="1">Title of the Poem</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="2">The poem’s title, whether in English or Anglo-Norman, appears to
          be apocryphal. Its first known use is in a Latin prologue of one of the extant
          Anglo-Norman versions of the poem (London, British Library, MS Egerton 846B), where it is
          given as <hi rend="italic">Castellum amoris</hi>, showing the title’s association with the
          poem by 1325.<note target="#23" type="footnotelink">23</note> The Vernon manuscript, as
          mentioned earlier, titles the poem <hi rend="italic">Castel of Love</hi> in its incipit,
          and most modern scholars use this title for the English poem, and <hi rend="italic">Le
            chasteau d’amour</hi> (or its Modern French version, <hi rend="italic">Le château
            d’amour</hi>) for the Anglo-Norman poem. <hi rend="italic">Castel</hi> is used in a
          figurative sense of the word, meaning “a spiritual fortress, a refuge; the stronghold of
          an emotion,”<note target="#24" type="footnotelink">24</note> and the title comes from the
          allegory in the poem of Mary’s body as a castle protecting Jesus, discussed below (see pp.
          15–18).</p>
        <p style="heading" n="2">Synopsis of The Castle of Love</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="3">The overarching narrative in both the Anglo-Norman <hi
            rend="italic">Chasteau d’amour</hi> and the Middle English <hi rend="italic">Castle of
            </hi><hi rend="italic">Love</hi> is that of salvation history, a popular topic in the
          Middle Ages. For medieval people, this “history” was the story of humanity as detailed in
          the Bible, encompassing the creation of the world and everything in it, the Fall of Adam
          and Eve through disobedience to God, the saving of humanity afterward through the
          sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the end of the world, and the future judgment of mankind at
          Judgment Day or Doomsday.<note target="#25" type="footnotelink">25</note> The mystery
          cycle plays (also called the Corpus Christi cycle) were a popular version of this type of
          narrative by the time of the Middle English <hi rend="italic">Castle of Love</hi>
          (although it is doubtful Grosseteste would have approved of them<note target="#26"
            type="footnotelink">26</note>).</p>
        <p style="body" n="5">The version of the story of salvation in the Middle English poem
          begins with the creation of the world and the subsequent casting of Lucifer (the Devil)
          into hell, along with many angels, because of their pride.<note target="#27"
            type="footnotelink">27</note> The narrator then tells the story from the biblical Book
          of Genesis of God’s creation of Adam, and subsequently of Eve from Adam’s rib, describing
          how the two then dwell in paradise until the Fall of mankind through sin. The sin is their
          disobedience to God’s command not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
          which resulted from the temptation of the Devil in the guise of a serpent and causes them
          to be cast out of paradise.</p>
        <p style="body" n="6">At this point, the poem departs from the Genesis narrative, describing
          how Adam lost his “seisin” (i.e., the world) and has become a “prisoner” because of his
          sin. The narrative then offers an allegory of the Four Daughters of the King (i.e., God),
          named Mercy, Truth, Justice, and Peace, who argue over whether to condemn the prisoner or
          release him. The King’s Son (i.e., Jesus), on hearing the dispute of his “sisters,” feels
          sorry for the prisoner and helps the sisters reconcile by taking the prisoner’s place,
          bearing all the punishment himself and thus redeeming Adam and saving all of humanity from
          the consequences of Adam’s sin. The narrative then explains “[h]ow ur Saveor wolde come”
          (line 596) and lists various biblical prophets who foretold the coming of Christ before
          focusing on a verse from the prophet Isaiah outlining the qualities of the Son (Jesus),
          which organizes the remainder of the narrative, as the poem annotates each characteristic
          from Isaias 9:6 in turn.<note target="#28" type="footnotelink">28</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="7">This extended exegesis on the verse from Isaias is punctuated by the
          story of Jesus’s Incarnation in the body of the Virgin Mary. To take the prisoner’s place,
          the Son (Jesus) must be born as a human, and Mary’s body is described in detail as a
          castle. Jesus’s birth happens so quietly that the Devil is not at first aware of him, but
          his lack of sin then draws the Devil’s attention. The Devil proceeds first to tempt Jesus
          by offering him the world and then to argue with him over mankind’s redemption. They
          negotiate a price: to get mankind out of prison, Jesus agrees to give up his whole body
          (i.e., die) and in the process suffer all the pains that mankind would have suffered in
          hell. Before death, however, Jesus goes on to perform miracles as detailed in the Gospels:
          he turns water into wine at the wedding in Cana, feeds five thousand people with five
          loaves and two fish, and raises Lazarus from the dead.</p>
        <p style="body" n="8">In the final section of the poem, Jesus suffers crucifixion and death,
          is resurrected, meets with his disciples, and ascends into heaven. The poem then describes
          the events leading up to Doomsday or the Last Judgment, when everyone will face God’s
          judgment. The poem ends with the division of the saved and the damned into heaven and
          hell, respectively, including a description of what each place will be like. A few lines
          are missing from the end (as evident from comparison with the Anglo-Norman poem), so the
          Middle English narrative closes at the end of the poem’s imaginary description of
          heaven.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="3">Date, Audiences, and Language</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="4">The audience Southern proposes is one of “knightly retainers and
          officials in a great household,” based on the poem’s addresses to the audience and
          “general style,” without suggesting a date of composition.<note target="#29"
            type="footnotelink">29</note> Kari Sajavaara dates Grosseteste’s writing of the
          Anglo-Norman poem to between 1230 and 1253, identifying a possible audience of “noble
          youths” living in Grosseteste’s household.<note target="#30" type="footnotelink">30</note>
          These youths might have been, as first suggested by M. Dominica Legge, two of Simon de
          Montfort’s sons fostered there, which would date the poem at about 1250.<note target="#31"
            type="footnotelink">31</note> Evelyn A. Mackie makes a strong case for dating the
          Anglo-Norman poem more narrowly, to probably between 1230 and 1235, when Grosseteste was
          teaching the Franciscans of Oxford, whom Mackie identifies as the most likely original
            audience.<note target="#32" type="footnotelink">32</note> This group would have included
          laypeople, knights, and nobles, among others, as “Grosseteste’s responsibilities as lector
          to the Oxford convent would have required him to teach the entire community, not only
          those members intent on university studies.”<note target="#33" type="footnotelink"
            >33</note> Mackie points out based on scribal interventions that the manuscripts
          themselves provide information suggesting audiences were of differing social ranks.<note
            target="#34" type="footnotelink">34</note> Andrew Reeves accepts Mackie’s assessment and
          theorizes that the poem was intended “to instruct laypeople or to help others instruct
          laypeople” and that it might have been intended as a Franciscan “preaching aid.”<note
            target="#35" type="footnotelink">35</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="9">Guiding the laity gained new importance after the Fourth Lateran
          Council of 1215, which called “for the cultivation of inward contemplation amongst the lay
          Christian population.”<note target="#36" type="footnotelink">36</note> Although reforms
          had already been going on in the previous century, Lateran IV codified several
          requirements for what clergy should teach laypeople. The canons issued at the council
          covered the doctrinal understanding of the Trinity, the Eucharist, and Penance, and they
          also demonstrated concern for “church discipline, clerical morals, episcopal elections,
          canon law, finances, and the treatment of heretics and Jews.”<note target="#37"
            type="footnotelink">37</note> One focus of the canons was to raise the bar for education
          and preparation of the clergy so that they might minister to and guide the laity.<note
            target="#38" type="footnotelink">38</note> More specific, though, was that all
          Christians were now required to partake in Communion and confession annually, which in
          turn required “instruction on the nature and implications of those sacraments.”<note
            target="#39" type="footnotelink">39</note> Bishops were obligated to hold synods and
          issue statutes to begin implementing the canons, defining the goals of pastoral care the
          clergy under their authority should have for instructing laypeople.<note target="#40"
            type="footnotelink">40</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="10">Pastoral care — ultimately the enterprise of saving souls — should be
          the overriding goal of the clergy, in Grosseteste’s view.<note target="#41"
            type="footnotelink">41</note> His statutes for the diocese of Lincoln reveal typical
          concerns, such as some priests relying on “their deacons [to] hear confessions” or
          “extort[ing] money from the laity for sacraments, including confession, or impos[ing]
          fines as penances.”<note target="#42" type="footnotelink">42</note> The statutes are
          somewhat spare, however, as Grosseteste took for granted that clergy would read additional
          works on pastoral instruction or <hi rend="italic">pastoralia</hi>.<note target="#43"
            type="footnotelink">43</note>
          <hi rend="italic">Pastorialia</hi> could be intended for the clergy or laity, and
          Grosseteste wrote works for each.<note target="#44" type="footnotelink">44</note> His
          output was considerable, with thirteen Latin texts and three Anglo-Norman ones (four if
          the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> is counted).<note target="#45" type="footnotelink"
            >45</note> Much can be gleaned from his <hi rend="italic">pastoralia</hi>, particularly
          the <hi rend="italic">Deus </hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi> [<hi rend="italic">God
            is</hi>],<note target="#46" type="footnotelink">46</note> a treatise on confession, and
          the <hi rend="italic">Templum Dei</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Temple of God</hi>], “a manual
          to prepare confessors” that also “includes a treatment of virtues and vices, the Lord’s
          Prayer, the Beatitudes, and the sacraments.”<note target="#47" type="footnotelink"
            >47</note> With its emphasis on confession, Grosseteste’s vision of pastoral care
          focused on the individual and also encompassed the salvation of all humanity, which
          included “guiding [humanity] towards the restoration of its relationship with God, and
          repairing the relationship between God and the natural world that the Fall had
            fractured.”<note target="#48" type="footnotelink">48</note> In addition, Grosseteste’s
          personal supervision of his diocese reveals the high value he placed on direct and
          unmediated pastoral care. For example, when newly consecrated as bishop, he traveled
          extensively throughout his diocese despite his age, a pattern that continued throughout
          his tenure.<note target="#49" type="footnotelink">49</note> Grosseteste felt so strongly
          about the importance of saving souls as a primary pastoral goal that in 1250 he attended a
          papal audience where he expressed concern about the tendency to appoint clergy more for
          “bureaucratic convenience, political expediency and family connexions” than for “saving
          souls from damnation” and asserted that he considered himself “personally accountable to
          God for each soul in his diocese.”<note target="#50" type="footnotelink">50</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="11">A work like the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> addresses the
          preeminent pastoral concern of soul saving by giving readers the opportunity to grapple
          personally with a spectrum of theological concepts through its use of narrative,
          allegories, and debate. These techniques could entertain while offering religious
          instruction — a juxtaposition that might please a wide range of audiences, both clerical
          and lay. Enjoyment of Grosseteste’s poem was driven in part by a rising enthusiasm for
          religious texts that expanded after Lateran IV.<note target="#51" type="footnotelink"
            >51</note> As Andrew Taylor points out, the thirteenth century, when Grosseteste was
          writing, saw a marked increase in demand among lay readers for religious content.<note
            target="#52" type="footnotelink">52</note> Some wealthy thirteenth-century lay readers,
          desperate for more complex religious instruction, even “acquired copies of the vernacular
          handbooks composed for their priests,” in addition to commissioning copies of texts more
          in line with their own requirements as lay readers.<note target="#53" type="footnotelink"
            >53</note> The <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> itself rode a “new wave of vernacular
          poems, embodying spiritual and devotional truths in the form of chivalric or visionary
          narratives which emerged around 1220,” that arose from the call of Lateran IV.<note
            target="#54" type="footnotelink">54</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="12">The manuscript traditions of the Anglo-Norman and Middle English
          versions offer evidence for their life after composition or translation, suggesting that
          over time the poem both maintained ecclesiastical connections and remained popular among
          lay people. Even the range in quality of the manuscripts that include the poem, from
          likely bespoke to those perhaps produced as part of the commercial book trade that was on
          the rise, indicates that all kinds of people enjoyed the poem.<note target="#55"
            type="footnotelink">55</note> Mackie notes the ownership by religious establishments of
          four extant manuscripts and an additional twelve attested in medieval library
            catalogs.<note target="#56" type="footnotelink">56</note> The provenance of several
          manuscripts likewise illustrates the ongoing interest women displayed in the poem.<note
            target="#57" type="footnotelink">57</note> For example, a copy of the Anglo-Norman poem
          was made for the noblewoman Joan Tateshal in the late thirteenth century as part of a
          devotional manuscript.<note target="#58" type="footnotelink">58</note> A
          fourteenth-century copy may have been prepared for the nunnery that owned it, or possibly
          for a novice.<note target="#59" type="footnotelink">59</note> In the fifteenth century, a
          manuscript including the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> was produced for Margaret of
          York, duchess of Burgundy.<note target="#60" type="footnotelink">60</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="13">Multilingual audiences form another important group, one of
          particular interest to an edition of a Middle English translation of an Anglo-Norman work.
          Maureen B. M. Boulton identifies several bi- and trilingual manuscripts that contain
          versions of the poem in either Anglo-Norman or Middle English.<note target="#61"
            type="footnotelink">61</note> Boulton emphasizes the inclusion of a prologue in Latin in
          many Anglo-Norman copies, and in two cases regular annotations in Latin either summarizing
          material or citing “scriptural and patristic authorities.”<note target="#62"
            type="footnotelink">62</note> The source poem’s code-switching between Latin and
          Anglo-Norman highlights the relation of audience to language, as does the strong interest
          in translating and adapting the Anglo-Norman poem into Middle English (as evinced by the
          four independent translations that survive, discussed below in the section on Popularity
          and Influences on Later Works; see pp. 26–27). Implicit in the act of translation or
          adaptation into English from Anglo-Norman is the issue of who the poem is for, a question
          that highlights the importance of understanding the multilingual reality of the medieval
          period. Jocelyn Wogan-Browne points out the problematic nature of “conceptualizing two
          separate vernacular languages and traditions, the English of England and the French of
          England” because “[t]he idea of a culture as a monoglot entity proceeding in organic
          linearity through time and within the territories of a modern nation state cannot
          adequately represent medieval textual production and linguistic and cultural
            contacts.”<note target="#63" type="footnotelink">63</note> Indeed, the two languages
          demonstrate “a deeply interwoven lexical borrowing back and forth . . . that makes the
          boundaries of our modern dictionaries of ‘Middle English’ and ‘Anglo-Norman’ themselves
            problematic.”<note target="#64" type="footnotelink">64</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="14">The opening lines of both the Anglo-Norman and Middle English texts
          draw attention to the multilingualism of audiences in England at the same time as they
          avow linguistic limitations in conventional ways. The narrator of the Anglo-Norman poem
          explains the intention to write in “romance” [French] (Appendix, line 26) because not
          everyone can praise God in languages they do not know well — in this case, Hebrew, Greek,
          and Latin (Appendix, lines 16–18).<note target="#65" type="footnotelink">65</note> The
          narrator of the Middle English poem adapts this motif, announcing the intention to make
          the work accessible by writing in English for an unlearned audience unfamiliar with French
          and Latin: “Ne mowe we alle Latin wite, / Ne Ebreu, ne Gru that beth iwrite, / Ne French,
          ne this other spechen” [Nor can we all know Latin, / Nor Hebrew, nor Greek that are
          written, / Nor French, nor these other languages] (lines 23–25). This is a common motif in
          English prologues,<note target="#66" type="footnotelink">66</note> one which the narrator
          circles back to and elaborates on later in the passage:</p>

        <quote>[Though it (i.e., the poem) is hard to understand and obscure in English / And has no

        <p style="bodysubsection" n="1">Here the narrator apologizes because English is not for
          educated people, but the subsequent lines reassure readers about the legitimacy of using
          English to understand religious truths.<note target="#67" type="footnotelink">67</note>
          The narrator asserts that the wise and prudent reader who “yerne biholdeth this ilke writ”
          [attentively contemplates this very treatise] (line 76) may, despite the language, still
          find “[a]lle poyntes . . . / Of ure beleeve and Godes lay” [all points . . . about faith
          and God’s law] (lines 79–80).</p>
        <p style="body" n="15">That the translator adapted the list of languages from the prologue
          of the Anglo-Norman work into the Middle English poem illustrates that such overt
          discussions about writing in the vernacular for so-called unlearned readers are not unique
          to English prologues but are a feature of the period.<note target="#68"
            type="footnotelink">68</note> The translator’s comments about English in these passages
          nevertheless reflect an anxiety that rests on the changed status of the language after the
          transition from Old to Middle English. Old English was the language of government and
          literature during the early English period, but this changed after the Norman Conquest of
          England in 1066.<note target="#69" type="footnotelink">69</note> King William replaced the
          governmental use of English with Latin, a change that Thomas Hahn argues undermined the
          importance of written English.<note target="#70" type="footnotelink">70</note> French was
          imported along with Latin after the Conquest and became a standard literary language in
          the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Thus, in simple terms, Latin was the language of
          learning and government, accessible mainly to clerks; French was the standard for
          literature; and English represented the vernacular, oral culture.<note target="#71"
            type="footnotelink">71</note> Nevertheless, it is important to understand these
          distinctions as fluid and evolving rather than fixed and separate. As Mark Faulkner points
          out, “[n]ot all languages were equal in their prestige, scope for conveying complex ideas
          and potential for an audience, and their capacity for each was constantly changing.”<note
            target="#72" type="footnotelink">72</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="16">James H. Morey argues against the idea that English before the end of
          the fourteenth century should be understood as “the silenced language,” since it still
          operated “as an important language of social, commercial, and religious discourse
          throughout the period.”<note target="#73" type="footnotelink">73</note> Although Morey
          points to the difficulty in pinning down the success of English in relation to Latin and
          Anglo-Norman in the thirteenth century, some scholars aim to bridge that gap.<note

          Middle English in <hi rend="italic">A New Literary</hi><hi rend="italic"> History of the

          as “inscrutable” or “a period of disjunction” for the English language.<note target="#75"
            type="footnotelink">75</note> For Faulkner, the idea of a “rupture” in twelfth-century
          English is problematic, as it does not account for works that might be twelfth-century
          being characterized as Old English, the recent “steady stream of (re)discoveries of
          twelfth-century texts,” or the ease of coming up with “a generically diverse list” of
          texts in English most likely written in the so-called long twelfth century.<note
            target="#76" type="footnotelink">76</note> Faulkner further highlights the importance of
          examining texts as multilingual productions in their cultural contexts and sees English
          society after the Conquest moving toward multilingualism.<note target="#77"
            type="footnotelink">77</note> Indeed, even by the middle of the century preceding
          Grosseteste’s writing, many writers could speak, read, and write multiple languages, thus
          enabling them to make the best linguistic choices to support “their literary aspirations,
          linguistic competency and intended audience.”<note target="#78" type="footnotelink"
            >78</note> Grosseteste himself chose Anglo-Norman for the <hi rend="italic"

          Latin.</p>
        <p style="body" n="17">Although English becomes more important as a literary language over
          the course of the fourteenth century, Wogan-Browne notes that “reports of the
          fourteenth-century death of Anglo-Norman have been exaggerated.”<note target="#79"
            type="footnotelink">79</note> Richard Ingham points out that the use of French in
          England was not isolated to literary efforts, as it was used administratively from the
          mid-thirteenth century onward.<note target="#80" type="footnotelink">80</note> The
          fourteenth century then saw steep gains in French replacing Latin “for administrative and
          commercial purposes.”<note target="#81" type="footnotelink">81</note> Similarly, the use
          of French in legal contexts spanned the period from 1275 to 1417.<note target="#82"
            type="footnotelink">82</note> Ingham further explains that the lack of regular
          orthography and grammar in Anglo-Norman texts points to its persistence as a spoken
          language into the later medieval period in England and notes that evidence suggests
          pronunciation influenced the orthography of the written language.<note target="#83"
            type="footnotelink">83</note> Anglo-Norman was not simply learned in school as a second
          language but rather continued to develop as a dialect alongside continental French until
          the late-fourteenth century.<note target="#84" type="footnotelink">84</note> Even the
          Vernon manuscript (discussed below; see pp. 31–33), one of the preeminent manuscript
          collections of Middle English verse, is itself a trilingual manuscript; though
          predominately English in its contents, the codex includes some Anglo-Norman and
            Latin.<note target="#85" type="footnotelink">85</note> Although one or the other may
          dominate at different times, it may be more profitable to think of English and
          Anglo-Norman as “sister vernaculars,” to modify a phrase from Thelma Fenster and Carolyn
            Collette.<note target="#86" type="footnotelink">86</note> The relation between the two
          languages reflects “complementarity” rather than competition between “differing
          communities with opposed interests.”<note target="#87" type="footnotelink">87</note> Just
          as the Anglo-Norman poem’s narrator positions French as the vernacular against Hebrew,
          Greek, and Latin, the narrator of the Middle English poem in turn positions English as the
          vernacular against Latin, Hebrew, Greek, and French. The point is that all three languages
          — Latin, French, and English — were used in literary works throughout the medieval period,
          to a greater or lesser extent, and that ebb and flow is reflected in both the Middle
          English and Anglo-Norman poems presented in this volume.<note target="#88"

        <p style="heading" n="4">Sources</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="5">As mentioned earlier, the source for the Middle English <hi
            rend="italic">Castle of Love</hi> is the Anglo-Norman <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi><hi
            rend="italic"> d’amour</hi>. There is not a single source for the <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau</hi>; it is rather a narrative tapestry that weaves together strands from a
          variety of sources. The opening sections describing the creation of Adam and Eve and their
          Fall through disobedience originate in the Bible’s creation story in Genesis (1–3). The
          allegory of the Four Daughters of God has its seeds in parables and allegories derived
          from Psalm 84:11, and the allegory of the Castle of Love has its genesis in exegesis of
          Luke 10:38. Jesus’s life, including the miracles he performs, his suffering and
          Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension into heaven all come from the New Testament
          (mainly the Gospels). The section detailing the signs leading up to the Last Judgment,
          which is an interpolation appearing only in the Middle English version, is a variant of
            <hi rend="italic">The Fifteen</hi><hi rend="italic"> Signs Before Doomsday</hi>.<note
            target="#93" type="footnotelink">93</note> Finally, the Last Judgment of the dead and
          the visions of hell and heaven echo various biblical descriptions but also have their
          source in Grosseteste’s own ideas about the afterlife, as detailed in letters and other
            writings.<note target="#94" type="footnotelink">94</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="19">Southern sees the Anglo-Norman <hi rend="italic">Chasteau d</hi><hi

          comprehensive summation of his theological views.<note target="#95" type="footnotelink"
            >95</note> Southern points out that “[a]dvanced scientific learning and theological
          concepts on the fringe of eccentricity flowed irresistibly into his poetry of popular
          instruction,” as if Grosseteste “could not keep these thoughts out of his theology even on
          the most popular level.”<note target="#96" type="footnotelink">96</note> The Middle
          English translation leaves out at least one of the most difficult concepts (as I discuss
          below; see pp. 22–25) but nevertheless maintains much of the theological complexity of the
          Anglo-Norman poem. But the popular and philosophical-theological themes are not really in
          conflict, and we should understand their juxtaposition as a feature of the poem, not a
          bug, as the Anglo-Norman <hi rend="italic">Chasteau d’amour</hi> and the Middle English
            <hi rend="italic">Castle</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Love</hi> alike meld high theology
          and philosophy with genres that appealed to lay audiences.</p>
        <p style="body" n="20">Despite omitting some of the more esoteric concepts, <hi
            rend="italic">The Castle of Love</hi>, like its Anglo-Norman precursor, touches on a
          number of theological doctrines. These include the concept of the Trinity, the procession
          of the Holy Spirit from the Father and Son, Jesus as fully God and fully human in the
          Incarnation, natural law (innate moral feeling, arrived at through reason) and positive
          law (divine law, created and imposed), the idea that God the Father created everything
          through the Son (i.e., Jesus), Mary’s perpetual virginity, the seven deadly sins, Christ’s
          judgment of the living and the dead in the Last Judgment, and the resurrection of the
          faithful at the Last Judgment, among others. The poem also successfully marries exegesis,
          exempla, theological complexity, and the themes of devotional literature with popular
          genres such as allegory, debate and dialogue, drama, and courtly or chivalric tales. Both
          poems likewise make use of popular narrative tropes, such as addressing the audience,
          meant to evoke an oral storytelling or reading performance.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="5">Allegory of the Four Daughters of God</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="6">The allegory of the Four Daughters of God features the
          personified virtues Mercy, Truth, Justice, and Peace, named Merci, Soth, Riht, and Pees in
          the Middle English poem, and Misericorde, Verité, Justize, and Pes in the Anglo-Norman
            one.<note target="#97" type="footnotelink">97</note> In a kind of courtroom drama, the
          daughters argue the case of a “prisoner” (Adam) confined because of his sin. This “trial”
          of the prisoner is a debate between the four sisters before their father, the King, whom
          the prisoner has wronged. The dramatic twist comes when their “brother,” the King’s Son
          (i.e., Jesus), offers to take the place of the prisoner in order to free him. The names of
          the daughters derive from Psalm 84:11: “Mercy and truth have met each other: justice and

            >102</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="21">The allegory of the Four Daughters of God (lines 275–554 of the
          Middle English poem; lines 205–456 of the Anglo-Norman poem in the Appendix) opens with
          the description of a King (God) and his family: a Son (Jesus) and Four Daughters (Merci,
          Soth, Riht, and Pees). Having set up this familial situation, the narrator explains, “This
          Kyng, as you herdest ar this, / Hedde a thral that dude amis” [This King, as you heard
          before this, / Had a slave that did wrong] (lines 307–08). These lines reveal the relative
          relations between God and Adam as those between the King and his “thral.” The poem’s use
          of the word “thral” here echoes the narrator’s earlier explanation that Adam has become
          “[s]unnes thral” [sin’s slave] (line 242) because of the consequences of his
          transgression, emphasizing that a “thral may not crave / Throw riht non heritage to have”
          [slave may not demand / To have any heritage through right] because “[a]s sone as he is
          thral bicome, / His heritage is him binome” [as soon as he has become a slave, / His
          heritage is taken away from him] (lines 249–52). In other words, Adam has lost his right
          to his heritage because he has become “[s]unnes thrall” as a result of his disobedience to
          God’s laws.</p>
        <p style="body" n="22">The word “thral” is only used in the poem in two passages: the
          section describing the consequences of the Fall and throughout the allegory of the Four
          Daughters of God. The link to the earlier usage not only shows that the “thral” is Adam
          but also makes clear that he is the King’s “thral” because of his transgression, not
          because he is meant to be a slave or servant to the King. Although the word “thral” can
          mean in literal terms “a slave, servant, serf,” or “a subject,” it can also designate “a
          prisoner, captive.”<note target="#103" type="footnotelink">103</note> Adam’s relationship
          to God should have been that of a vassal with a seisin, but he has lost his right to his
          inheritance and now is simply a prisoner. The use of “thral” in the allegory emphasizes
          Adam’s status as prisoner throughout the argument between the sisters, as the narrator
          refers to the “thral” being released from prison (lines 359, 368), mentions the “thral”
          being sentenced to death (lines 410, 424), and at one point directly equates the terms:
          “the thral, the prisoun, / Mote come to sum raunsoun” [the slave, the prisoner, / Must
          come to a redemption (i.e., be redeemed)] (lines 513–14).</p>
        <p style="body" n="23">Throughout the allegory, Merci and Pees advocate the prisoner’s
          release, whereas Soth and Riht argue for his condemnation. Merci blames the prisoner’s
          enemies, as they seduced him through their promise that he would have God’s power if he
          ate the fruit of the forbidden tree, and advocates mercy and forgiveness for him. Truth
          argues against Merci’s desire to release the prisoner, insisting that he sinned, and the
          King should not listen to Merci. Truth says the prisoner deserves what he gets and should
          stay in prison; he has lost mercy and forgiveness, and he was warned beforehand. Riht says
          she is the magistrate and that just judgments come from the King. She contends that the
          prisoner deserves death because he turned away from Merci, Pees, Soth, and Riht and left
          them of his own free will; if justice prevails, the prisoner will suffer death, for Soth
          has witnessed that he is guilty, and Riht, as magistrate, is willing to pass sentence on
          him. Pees finally speaks up and complains that Soth and Riht have forsaken her by making
          their judgment without Pees, and that they also refuse to allow Merci to sway them. Pees
          appeals the judgment of Soth and Riht, saying it is unacceptable and too violent without
          Merci and Pees, and that no judgment should be made until all four sisters agree. She then
          says she will flee and not return unless all her sisters are reconciled. The King’s Son
          then addresses his father and says he will reconcile the sisters by putting on “the
          thralles weden” [the slave’s clothes] (line 547) and “holde the doom” [endure the
          punishment] (line 549) that Soth and Riht “wolden and beoden” [order and command] (line
          548). The framing of the story of Christ’s redemption of humanity as a tale of a king and
          his children, of lost inheritance and reconciliation, calls to mind popular courtly and
          chivalric literature but then uses these motifs in a theological context, just as the
          allegory of the Castle of Love does.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="6">Allegory of the Castle of Love</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="7">The dispute between the Four Daughters of God and the resolution
          of their conflict through the Son sets up in turn the allegory of Mary’s body as the
          Castle of Love, which represents the Incarnation of Jesus. The allegory of the Castle of
          Love is related to the more general one of the castle of the body, used in poems such as
          Thomas of Hales’s <hi rend="italic">Love Rune</hi>.<note target="#104" type="footnotelink"
            >104</note> The idea of the castle or household representing the soul under siege is

          of the household, and the Four Daughters of God (in this case the cardinal virtues of
          Vigilance, Spiritual Strength, Moderation, and Righteousness) must help guard the soul
          against Wit’s wayward wife Will and the vices led by the Fiend (Devil).<note target="#105"

          biblical text as an allegory of Jesus’ entry into Mary’s womb.”<note target="#107"
            type="footnotelink">107</note> The motif was generally popular in sermons in England by
          the twelfth century.<note target="#108" type="footnotelink">108</note> But, whereas
          earlier references to the Virgin drawing on architecture were limited to religious
          contexts, in the twelfth century, vernacular literary versions began to make use of the
            motif.<note target="#109" type="footnotelink">109</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="24">The description of the castle in the allegory is elaborate and highly
          symbolic, a fact the poem itself highlights with its explicit interpretations of the
          castle’s architecture and colors. The castle is described as “[m]uche and feir and
          loveliche” [great and strong and lovely] (line 668), with a tower surrounded by a
          defensive trench impenetrable to any “kunnes asaylyng” [kind of military assault] (line
          675). It stands in the borderland and fears no foe; it is on a high cliff where siege
          engines cannot harm it. It stands on a firm rock surrounded by deep ditches; four small
          towers surround the tower’s perimeter, and there are three baileys to defend it. Its
          battlements are protected by seven barbicans (outer fortifications), each with a gate and
          tower, and no one who flees there for protection will be harmed by enemies.</p>
        <p style="body" n="25">The castle is colored on the outer walls with three colors: the
          foundation is green; the middle color is indigo blue; the uppermost color illuminates
          everything around it and is redder than any rose. Within, the castle shines as white as
          snow, and the light is cast so wide that wrong can never come there. From the midst of the
          high tower springs a well that always flows, with four streams that flow upon the gravel
          and fill the moats. Whoever may draw this water need not seek any other medicine. There is
          a white ivory throne in the tower, brighter than the summer sun, cleverly made, with seven
          steps leading to it, surrounded by a rainbow. No king or emperor ever had a fairer throne.
          Where God chose his inn, there will never be another such castle: “the castle of love and
          lisse, / Of solace, of socour, of joye and blisse, / Of hope, of hele, of sikerness” [the
          castle of love and delight, / Of comfort, of refuge, of joy and bliss, / Of hope, of
          salvation, of safety] (lines 757–59).</p>
        <p style="body" n="26">The narrator then explains the meaning of the castle and its design:
          “This is the Maydenes [i.e., Virgin Mary’s] bodi so freo” (line 761). The firm rock is the
          Virgin’s heart, which sin never entered. The greenness of the foundation is the Virgin’s
          faith, for faith is the foundation of all virtues. The middle color (blue) signifies
          sweetness and beauty; the meaning is that she was busy in sweetness to serve God in
          humility. The third color (red), the uppermost, that casts its light over everything as
          though it were burning, is the love clear and bright with which she is all alight, and she
          is moved by the fire of love to serve God above her. The four small towers that protect
          the high tower are the cardinal virtues, Fortitude, Prudence, Justice, and Temperance, and
          every one has a gate with a defensive machine so that wickedness cannot enter. Of the
          three baileys, the innermost signifies the Virgin’s holy virginity, the middle signifies
          her holy chastity, and the outermost signifies her holy marriage. The seven barbicans
          (fortifications) that protect this castle so well with arrow and crossbow bolt, are the
          seven virtues that overcome the seven deadly sins. Pride, the beginning and root of all
          evil, is overcome by Humbleness; True Love (Charity) overcomes Envy; Abstinence overcomes
          Gluttony; Lust is made to flee through Mary’s holy Chastity; Covetousness (Greed) is
          destroyed through Generosity; Wrath (Anger) is overcome by Patience; and spiritual Joy
          destroys Sloth.<note target="#110" type="footnotelink">110</note> The well that fills the
          moat is God’s grace; God loved this Virgin so much he gave the full amount of grace to
          her, through whom the grace that overflows saves all the world even now. The moats are her
          long-suffering poverty, through whom the Devil is overcome, and his power destroyed. At
          the end of this instructive section, the narrator’s own voice intrudes into the poem, as
          he bangs on the gate to the castle and directly addresses the Virgin Mary, requesting help
          against his three foes, the World, the Flesh, and the Devil (enemies of mankind in
          Christian tradition), who have beset him with armies.</p>
        <p style="body" n="27">Southern suggests that the castle is “of up-to-date design,”
          identifying “the extreme elaboration and modernity of the castle’s outworks and
          fortifications” as particular to Grosseteste.<note target="#111" type="footnotelink"
            >111</note> But even if the architectural features described are real, the castle itself
          is unrealistic. Boulton points out, for example, the contrast between the number of
          barbicans (seven), and real castles of the period, which might have up to two.<note
            target="#112" type="footnotelink">112</note> Likewise, Abigail Wheatley argues that the
          Castle of Love does not represent a real building but is rather an “architectural
          mnemonic” meant to help “the recall of a series of sacred texts and devotional
            precepts.”<note target="#113" type="footnotelink">113</note> Mackie sees the castle’s
          architecture evoking the details of New Jerusalem’s biblical description (from the
          Apocalypse) and some of its medieval interpretations.<note target="#114"
            type="footnotelink">114</note> The ideas that the architecture in Grosseteste’s poem
          makes use of real design elements or that it is highly symbolic do not necessarily
          conflict. The use of recognizably specific and tangible architectural features to express
          ideas of symbolic or theological importance could be a way of using the concrete to help
          audiences understand the figurative. Wheatley nevertheless rejects the view of
          architecture being used in this way: “Far from representing the mediation of difficult
          theology through an essentially lay and medieval symbol, Grosseteste’s <hi rend="italic"
            >Château</hi><hi rend="italic"> d’Amour</hi> expresses the strength of the castle as a
          Biblical type and religious image.”<note target="#115" type="footnotelink">115</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="28">Christiania Whitehead sees the castle as equally figurative, linking
          the treatment of Mary as a castle in Grosseteste’s poem with the depictions of “virginity
          as an inviolate castle” that permeate the <hi rend="italic">Ancrene Wisse</hi>.<note
            target="#116" type="footnotelink">116</note> Whitehead questions whether Grosseteste may
          have meant Mary’s body in the poem to be interpreted as “an anchoritic <hi rend="italic"
            >exemplum</hi>” in which Grosseteste perhaps deliberately highlights similarities
          between Mary’s “vocation of intact perfection and that of the thirteenth-century
            anchoresses.”<note target="#117" type="footnotelink">117</note> Whitehead sees the
          impenetrable castle “[w]orking in conscious contradiction to normative perceptions of
          fallen femininity as open, breachable and characterized by incompletion and excessive
          release of moisture”; thus, “[t]he writing of Mary as a castle stands as a total annulment
          of her female physicality.”<note target="#118" type="footnotelink">118</note> Whitehead
          points out that, at the same time, the intrusion of the narrator’s voice into the final
          section of the allegory, as he bangs on the gate begging Mary for entry to protect him
          from the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, effectively undermines the idea of the inviolate
          virgin because of the frequent association of such scenes with secular romances, where
          “the courtly castle of the flesh is built to await violation”; that is, the assault on a
          castle is a metaphor for an attempt on virginity, whether through rape or seduction.<note
            target="#119" type="footnotelink">119</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="29">Karin Boklund-Lagopoulou points out, however, that even if “many of
          the poems to the Virgin make use of the language of courtly love, they never catalogue the
          beauties of Mary’s body” because religious poetry conceptualizes Mary’s body “in multiple
          metaphors, derived from centuries of patristic biblical hermeneutics.”<note target="#120"
            type="footnotelink">120</note> The focus on Mary’s virginity illustrates this aspect of
          the religious use of the courtly motif of virginity as a “locked gate” of the castle, most
          clearly represented in <hi rend="italic">The Castle of Love</hi> as the “faste gat”
          [closed gate] (line 877) that Jesus both enters and exits in the course of the Incarnation
          without opening (see lines 877–88). Wheatley connects the gate to Ezechiel 44:2: “And the
          Lord said to me: This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall pass
          through it: because the Lord the God of Israel hath entered in by it, and it shall be
          shut”; more prominently, the “faste gat” refers to Mary’s virginity<note target="#121"
            type="footnotelink">121</note> (perhaps even, in a literal sense, to the hymen). The
          “faste gat” emphasizes the idea that Mary remains a virgin even after she has conceived
          and born Jesus at the same time as it alludes to the idea of Mary as the “gate of heaven,”
          a metaphor Boklund-Lagopoulou explores in depth.<note target="#122" type="footnotelink"
            >122</note> In religious literature of the Middle Ages, Mary is represented as “sinless
          because she maintains her bodily virginity, her intact and unpenetrated body. Because she
          is a virgin and thus physically pure, her body can become a conduit, a passage or gateway
          between heaven and earth, God and man, spirit and flesh. Christ descended from heaven into
          her body; but also, in a reverse movement, sinners can pass <hi rend="italic">through</hi>
          Mary into heaven.”<note target="#123" type="footnotelink">123</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="30">As these interpretations highlight, Mary’s importance is primarily as
          a theological construct, not as a person. Whitehead points this out when she explores the
          relation of the castle allegory to the development of the cult of the Virgin Mary, “in
          which the architectural representation of the Virgin acts as an appropriate response to
          advances in Marian doctrine which, promoting the concepts of the Immaculate Conception and
          the Bodily Assumption, increasingly detach her from human limitation, and from the flaws
          and changes associated with sin, sex, age and death.”<note target="#124"
            type="footnotelink">124</note> Whether as a type of the New Jerusalem, an “architectural
          mnemonic,” an elaboration of the virgin-as-castle motif, “an anchoritic exemplum,” or a
          “gate of heaven,” Mary’s significance lies in her role as a double vessel: that of the
          body that literally received Jesus in the Incarnation and that of the castle, which exists
          as a repository of theological interpretations. The poem in other words offers Mary’s body
          as a symbolic text for the reader’s pleasure and consumption. Just as the narrator
          elucidates the meaning of the architectural features and their colors in the description
          of the castle, so the representation of the architecture in the castle allegory invites
          analysis by the reader, following the narrator’s model. And just as the narrator intrudes
          into the narrative and pounds on the “faste gat,” asking Mary for help to save him from
          his enemies, so the reader may follow the narrator’s lead in intruding to beg entry to the
          castle.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="7">Courtly Romance</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="8">Part of the appeal of the poem was no doubt its use of tropes and
          conventions from popular genres. As we saw in the section on the Castle of Love allegory
          just above, the poem makes use of courtly or chivalric romance motifs in its treatment of
          Mary as a castle to be defended, with the dual implications of the “faste gat”(line 877)
          that protects both Jesus in the womb and Mary’s virginity from assault, calling to mind
          poems such as Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun’s <hi rend="italic">Le roman de
            </hi><hi rend="italic">la Rose</hi> [<hi rend="italic">The Romance of the Rose</hi>], a
          well-known example of a courtly romance where the assault on a castle is an attempt on
          virginity (Guillaume’s portion was written ca. 1230, around the same time as or slightly
          before the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>). Another aspect of the theme shows up in the
          Four Daughters of God allegory of the earlier part of the poem, discussed above (see pp.
          13–14), where we see the playing out of a domestic drama, in which the King is betrayed by
          his servant, who is then tried by the King’s Four Daughters, and subsequently redeemed by
          his Son.</p>
        <p style="body" n="31">Alongside these allegorical scenes, the poem’s language resonates
          with the courtly love genre in the deliberate use of “trewe love” to describe the love God
          wants from humanity (line 1024). The corresponding “fin amur” [true love] from the
          Anglo-Norman poem (Appendix, line 998) makes clear the implications of the phrase, which
          the Anglo-Norman poem uses again later to emphasize the degree of God’s love for humanity
          (Appendix, line 1376). Both “trewe love” and “fin amur” signify the concept of Christian
          love or <hi rend="italic">charité</hi> [charity]. The <hi rend="italic">AND</hi> defines
            <hi rend="italic">fin amur</hi> as “<hi rend="italic">fin amor</hi>, courtly love,”<note
            target="#125" type="footnotelink">125</note> but, despite its secular associations, “fin
          amur” had a dual resonance as a term for courtly love in lyric poetry as well as the
          perfect love of God in religious contexts.<note target="#126" type="footnotelink"
            >126</note> The frequent use in both poems of the more straightforward word “<hi
            rend="italic">charité</hi>” (lines 912, 987, 1162; Appendix, lines 697, 737, 820, 961,
          996), however, points to Grosseteste’s (and the translator’s) deliberate choice to evoke a
          courtly love context for understanding how humanity and God should love one another.</p>
        <p style="body" n="32">This juxtaposition of courtly love language with religious ideals was
          common in religious poetry. For example, we see a similar use in Thomas of Hales’s <hi
            rend="italic">Love Rune</hi>, a thirteenth-century Middle English poem that explores the
          confluence of holy and erotic love more overtly than the <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau</hi>.<note target="#127" type="footnotelink">127</note> As in the <hi
            rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>, the narrator of the poem uses <hi rend="italic">fyn
            amur</hi> in a religious context: “Mayde, al so ich the tolde, the ymston of thi bur /
          He is betere an hundred-folde than alle theos in heore culur; / He is idon in heovene
          golde, and is ful of <hi rend="italic">fyn amur</hi> [Maid, as I told you, the gemstone of
          your bower, / He is better a hundredfold than all these in their colors; / He is set in
          the gold of heaven, and is full of <hi rend="italic">fin amour</hi>] (Thomas of Hales, <hi
            rend="italic">Love Rune</hi>, ed. and trans. Fein, lines 89–91; italics in original).
          The description here dually refers to “Christ and the gem of virginity.”<note
            target="#128" type="footnotelink">128</note> In <hi rend="italic">The Castle </hi><hi
            rend="italic">of Love</hi>, Mary’s virginity is not a gem but rather a “faste gat” (line
          877), and her body as the castle is protected in part by “Trewe Love” (line 833), one of
          the seven virtues represented by the barbicans guarding the Castle of Love, a place where
          “Charité is constable” (line 912). The appropriation of courtly love language for
          religious contexts would still echo the secular poetry from which it was drawn, enhancing
          the enjoyment of audiences who wanted to be both religiously educated and entertained in a
          popular fashion.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="8">Debate and Legal Language</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="9">The “trial” of the “prisoner” (Adam) conducted by the Four
          Daughters of God and the later argument between Jesus and the Devil over Adam rely on the
          conventions of debate and dialogue, related types of poetry popular throughout the
          medieval period. The poem’s interest in legal language and the finer points of law,
          particularly evident in these sections, enhanced the drama of these episodes. This focus
          on what John A. Alford calls “the art of pleading” was part of a trend that began
          developing in debate and dialogue as early as <hi rend="italic">The </hi><hi rend="italic"
            >Owl and the Nightingale</hi>; the subgenre’s apex was arguably found in <hi
            rend="italic">Piers Plowman</hi>, which contains “several charters, court scenes, and
          hundreds of legal terms and maxims from common, civil, and canon law, so that in the whole
          history of English literature there is nothing even remotely to be compared with it.”<note
            target="#129" type="footnotelink">129</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="33">In the preamble to the allegory of the Four Daughters of God, the
          poem places sin in the context of feudal relations and legal consequences; that is, Adam’s
          sin causes his loss of his inheritance or seisin (i.e., possession of the world). The
          Anglo-Norman poem equates sin with the legal meaning of “defaute” as a failure to appear
          in court in answer to a summons:<note target="#130" type="footnotelink">130</note>
          “Pecché, ad parole breve, /Est defaute apertement; / Defaute e pecché en un se entent”
          [Sin, in a brief word, / Is clearly default; / Default and sin are considered as one]
          (Appendix, lines 160–62). The explanation of this “defaute” occurs two lines later:
          “Defaute aprés defaute a fine / Fet par dreit perdre seysine” [Default after default in
          the end / Rightfully causes one to lose lawful possession] (Appendix, lines 165–66), the
          narrator adding that “[e]ncore en la curt le rey / Use l’um icele ley” [even now in the
          court of the king / One practices the aforesaid law] (Appendix, lines 167–68). This
          definition of “defaute” is based on a point of thirteenth-century English law referring to
          a defendant’s failed court appearance: if a defendant was in default (i.e., absent) two
          times without a legitimate excuse (“[d]efaute aprés defaute”), the court would award the
          disputed property to the plaintiff.<note target="#131" type="footnotelink">131</note>
          Alford quotes a specific hypothetical case studied by law students of the day, which
          explained: “il fayte outrement defaute e aspres defaute si perd seysine de terre” [he
          committed, finally, default after default, thus lost seisin of land].<note target="#132"
            type="footnotelink">132</note> Alford notes that Grosseteste borrowed this legal point
          “almost verbatim into his poem” and suggests he “redefined the term ‘defaute’ in order to
          make it fit.”<note target="#133" type="footnotelink">133</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="34"><hi rend="italic">The Castle of Love</hi> uses “wone” similarly to
          “defaute” but does not define the term in the same technical way. The narrator says that
          “sunne and wone, al is on” [sin and (de)fault, all is one] (line 233), where “wone” still
          refers to a failure to meet a legal requirement or a lack of conformity to law.<note
            target="#134" type="footnotelink">134</note> But the subsequent lines do not explain the
          point of law on which the idea turns, simply saying that Adam committed “wone” when he
          resisted God’s commandment and when he ate the apple, adding that “[t]horw wone he lees
          his seysyne, / Thorw wone he brouhte himself in pyne” [through sin he lost his seisin /
          Through sin he brought himself into pain] (lines 237–38). Like the <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau</hi>, the Middle English poem says that every day in the king’s court “[m]e
          useth thulke selve lay” [people enforce the very same law] (line 240), but there is no
          line equivalent to “[d]efaute aprés defaute.” This line in the <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau</hi> makes explicit Grosseteste’s meshing of sin with default, which
          undergirds the Anglo-Norman poem’s legal code and lays out Adam’s sin in familiar terms
          audiences could understand. As Jane Zatta points out, in the <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau</hi> “God operates under exactly the same code of laws as contemporary English
          kings, and it is by comparison to feudal reality and its values of descent, inheritance,
          and land, that Grosseteste explains the generosity of God and presents the rewards of
            salvation.”<note target="#135" type="footnotelink">135</note> Rhodes argues that the
          legal wrangling is one of the aspects of the poem that “humanizes [Grosseteste’s]
          characters” by “placing them in a familiar setting surrounded by familiar concerns.”<note
            target="#136" type="footnotelink">136</note> Just as contemporary English plaintiffs
          would have, Adam lost his inheritance through “defaute,” which stands for sin.<note
            target="#137" type="footnotelink">137</note> The Four Daughters of God allegory then
          offers a dramatic rendition that illustrates how the legal concepts play out in the
          world.</p>
        <p style="body" n="35">Like we saw in the allegory of the Four Daughters of God and the play
          between the meanings of “sin” and “defaute,” the dialogue between Jesus and the Devil in
          lines 1041–1132 of <hi rend="italic">The Castle of Love</hi> displays an interest in legal
          argumentation. More properly a dialogue than a courtroom drama, despite its legal
          “pleading,” the encounter alludes to the biblical account of Christ’s temptation in the
          wilderness. The conversation in the poem is a foreshortened and rearranged version of that
          in the Gospel of Matthew (see especially 4:8–10). The Devil attempts to argue his case for
          “seisyne,” saying, “icham prince and lord of this londe, / And in the seisyne habbe longe
          ibe / Thorw the heighe Kyng that grant hit me” [I am the prince and lord of this land, /
          And in the seisin (possession in freehold) have long been / Through the high King Who
          granted it to me] (lines 1048–50). Jesus retorts that the agreement was held until the
          Devil broke it by telling Adam he could eat the apple without consequences (lines
          1066–74). The Devil’s response is that he is “bitrayyed” and “thorw ple overcomen”
          [overcome by argumentation] (lines 1079–80), but he goes on to assert that Adam is his
          prisoner because he “hath misdon” [has done wrong (i.e., sinned)] (line 1087) and
          therefore must be ransomed from the Devil: “bote he beo forbought of me, / He ne oughte
          from wo disseysed be” [unless he be ransomed from me, / He should not be delivered from
          suffering] (lines 1089–90). The word “disseysed,” here translated as “delivered,” may be a
          deliberate play on the more common meanings of the verb: “to deprive (sb.) of seizin; to
          dispossess (sb.) unlawfully (of land, goods, etc.)” and “to deprive (sb.) of authority,
          dominion, or privileges.”<note target="#138" type="footnotelink">138</note> This wordplay
          illustrates some of the enjoyment offered by the legal wrangling between Jesus and the
          Devil throughout the scene.</p>
        <p style="body" n="36">The Devil’s demand in this dialogue for a ransom in order to release
          Adam has sometimes been interpreted as evidence of Grosseteste’s support for the Devil’s
          rights theory of Christ’s redemption of humanity.<note target="#139" type="footnotelink"
            >139</note> Sajavaara explains that there were two main threads to the theory, one
          juridical, based on the idea of Christ as a ransom for Adam, the other political,
          centering on the Devil’s abuse of power. The ransom idea held that “God and the Devil are
          . . . two opposing rulers, who desire man’s soul. Adam has the choice, and he chooses the
          Devil. To make man return to him God must give ransom to the Devil, and this ransom is his
          only Son”; the abuse of power view maintained that “[a] contract between God and the Devil
          stipulated the limits of their spheres and neither of them could infringe on the domain of
          the other. The life and death of fallen man was in the hands of the Devil, but he used his
          power on the Son and transgressed the contract.”<note target="#140" type="footnotelink"
            >140</note> C. W. Marx explains that in the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>’s debate
          between Christ and the Devil, Grosseteste ultimately rejects the idea of the Devil’s
            rights.<note target="#141" type="footnotelink">141</note> But, as Alford argues, even
          though the theory was debunked in the eleventh century, because of its “dramatic
          possibilities,” poets wanted to “keep the old analogy of ransom but qualify it by means of
          a debate between Christ and Satan in which the author of law himself would overthrow the
          Devil’s claims to any ‘rights.’”<note target="#142" type="footnotelink">142</note>
          Audiences knew how the conflict would turn out but enjoyed the process of seeing Jesus
          trick the Devil and win the debate. The Devil was sure that he would profit by Jesus’s
          death when he took the deal to exchange Jesus for the “prisoner,” the narrator explains,
          but instead is caught and defeated, “[a]s fisch that is with hok inomen, / That, whon the
          worm he swoleweth alast, / He is bi the hok itiyed fast” [as a fish that is captured with
          a fishhook / So that, when he at last swallows the worm, / He is tethered fast by the
          hook] (lines 1130–32; compare Appendix, lines 1106–08). The use of a proverbial saying to
          close the debate helps audiences connect with the narrative.<note target="#143"
            type="footnotelink">143</note> These dramatic scenes, such as the prisoner’s trial and
          the debate between Jesus and the Devil, offered medieval audiences the popular appeal
          characteristic of dialogues and debates and even evoked some of the pleasures of medieval
          drama.</p>

        <p style="bodyfirst" n="10">Although it is a translation, the Middle English poem is not
          simply a copy of the Anglo-Norman original, nor is it an oversimplified version of a more
          sophisticated poem. It is rather a series of contractions, expansions, reorganizations,
          interpolations, and gaps based on the needs and interests of its own audience and the
          knowledge and interpretations of the translator. Sajavaara notes that approximately
          seventy-four percent of the lines in the Middle English translation have matching verses
          in the Anglo-Norman text.<note target="#144" type="footnotelink">144</note> To understand
          more about the relation between the two poems, I examine two instances of theological
          complexity, one that appears only in the Anglo-Norman, and one that is preserved in both
          the Anglo-Norman and Middle English versions.</p>
        <p style="body" n="37">The first is the elision from the Middle English poem of two related
          philosophical-theological concepts: <hi rend="italic">natura naturans</hi> (God as the
          creator) and <hi rend="italic">natura naturata</hi> (nature as the creation).<note
            target="#145" type="footnotelink">145</note> Southern explains that Grosseteste’s use of
          these terms was meant “to express the unity of God and nature, both in the Creation and
          Incarnation” and suggests the translator probably left them out because they were “beyond
          the comprehension of a popular audience.”<note target="#146" type="footnotelink"
            >146</note> But such complexities did not necessarily put off medieval audiences.
          Consider that by the thirteenth century lay audiences were eating up religious poetry of
          instruction in the vernacular, such as a nearly fourteen-thousand-line didactic religious
          poem, Pierre d’Abernon’s popular <hi rend="italic">Lumere as </hi><hi rend="italic"
            >lais</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Light for the Laity</hi>], which accompanies the <hi
            rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> in one manuscript (see discussion of Bodley 399, pp. 41–42,
            below).<note target="#147" type="footnotelink">147</note> And by the fourteenth century,
          the Middle English <hi rend="italic">Castle of </hi><hi rend="italic">Love</hi> could be
          found in the Vernon manuscript together with the A-version of William Langland’s
          masterpiece of complexity, <hi rend="italic">Piers Plowman</hi>, which, despite “its
          inherent difficulties . . . was extremely popular in its own time, as more than fifty
          surviving manuscripts attest.”<note target="#148" type="footnotelink">148</note> As
          Rebecca Davis argues, Langland’s poem in fact took Grosseteste’s affirmation of “the
          intimacy between God and nature” one step further in the figure of Kynde, “<hi
            rend="italic">Piers Plowman</hi>’s daring merger of creator and creation.”<note
            target="#149" type="footnotelink">149</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="38">I suggest rather that the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>’s
          translator may have left out the passage including these concepts at least in part because
          the lines are just plain confusing, as is clear from the way they confounded medieval
          copyists, as well as modern editors and translators. In the following lines, the
          Anglo-Norman poem discusses the concepts of <hi rend="italic">natura naturans</hi> and <hi
            rend="italic">natura naturata</hi> (I have italicized the Anglo-Norman counterparts

        <p style="bodysubsection" n="2">These lines are difficult to interpret because it is unclear
          what could be meant by “[w]hen God the Creator / Is without knowledge of nature / When
          nature is created.” Perhaps “ignoraunce” is a metaphor meant to refer not to an absence of
          knowledge per se but rather to God’s lack of human nature before the Incarnation, after
          which Jesus becomes fully human while retaining full divinity, but the meaning is not
          self-evident. That these concepts were challenging not only to a potential translator but
          also to copyists of the Anglo-Norman poem is clear from the variants in this passage among
          the Anglo-Norman manuscripts — and the fact that one surviving copy leaves out the lines
          altogether; the fluidity of the lines among the Anglo-Norman copies implies that not all
          scribes copying their exemplars knew what the passage was saying.<note target="#150"
            type="footnotelink">150</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="39">The difficulty due to the word “ignoraunce” [ignorant, without
          knowledge] (Appendix, line 868) has led modern editors and translators to revise and
          interpret the passage to make sense of it. In his discussion of the lines, Southern
          sidesteps the problem by emending to “joygnante” in place of “ignoraunce,” changing “A
          nature est ignoraunce” to “A nature est joygnante.”<note target="#151" type="footnotelink"
            >151</note> The reason for this emendation is clear, since it makes better sense of the
          lines to say that “nature is greatly embellished when God is joined to nature,” and the
          change helps clarify that the lines refer to the Incarnation of Jesus. Unfortunately, the
          emendation to “joygnante” is not supported by any manuscript reading; although “joygnante”
          does occur in one copy of the poem, it is in place of “naturaunce” in the previous line
          (line 867), not in place of “ignoraunce.”<note target="#152" type="footnotelink"
            >152</note> In addition, it is unclear what should be done with the line, “Kaunt nature
          est naturee,”<note target="#153" type="footnotelink">153</note> if the previous line means
          something like “is joined to nature” (lit. “to nature is juxtaposed”<note target="#154"
            type="footnotelink">154</note>). Southern, Mackie, and Boulton all translate the passage
          using the emended reading (i.e., with “joined”),<note target="#155" type="footnotelink"
            >155</note> but only Mackie includes a direct translation of the line “Kaunt nature est
          naturee,” as “so that Nature was perfected.”<note target="#156" type="footnotelink"
            >156</note> These difficulties illustrate the challenges readers, translators, and
          copyists alike would have had in understanding the theological point being made.</p>
        <p style="body" n="40">Although it is certainly possible the surviving exemplars all contain
          some corruption of these lines, I suggest the difficulty of God’s “ignoraunce” of nature
          can be resolved by recognizing a deliberate ambiguity in the phrase “nature est naturee,”
          a line meant not as a direct translation but rather a riff on the philosophical term <hi
            rend="italic">nature naturee</hi> [the created world].<note target="#157"
            type="footnotelink">157</note> In this verse, the phrase arguably also refers to the
          Incarnation of Christ, with “nature” in “nature est naturee” referring simultaneously to
          creation and Creator. That is, the phrase means both “nature is created” and “the Creator
          is Incarnated.” The second interpretation suggests the idea of “est naturee” as the
          process of Jesus undergoing birth as a human being (through Mary’s Castle of Love) and
          acquiring “nature,” that is, both “human nature” and “the human form.”<note target="#158"
            type="footnotelink">158</note> The play on “naturee” likewise offers the sense of
          “natural, from birth” or “natural, innate,”<note target="#159" type="footnotelink"
            >159</note> which again emphasizes that Jesus is fully human, even as the earlier
          reference to “Nature naturaunce” alludes to God as the Creator and shows he is fully
          divine (a theological doctrine made clear in both versions of the poem).<note
            target="#160" type="footnotelink">160</note> As a continuation of this play on “nature,”
          “nature puree” in the subsequent line refers both to Christ’s human body and the perfected
          human nature that Jesus fulfills. The complex philosophical terminology, together with
          repetition of the word “nature” and related words, offer a convoluted play on words that
          underpins in turn a theological complexity that may have defeated the translator’s
          attempts to parse it, just as it has many modern readers. And even if the translator knew
          the technical terms and was familiar with the concepts, the exemplar may not have included
          the passage or may have garbled it enough to make it nonsensical.</p>
        <p style="body" n="41">The second comparison of the Middle English to the source poem, in
          contrast, shows that wordplay and complexity do not necessarily deter the translator, who
          in some cases chose instead to explore the earlier poem’s density. The difficulty arises
          in a passage of the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> where the narrator explains that the
          Child whom Isaiah foretold (i.e., Jesus) is both fully human and fully God, and “Par lui
          tute rien est fet, / E sanz lui nule rien n’est” [Through Him everything is created, / And
          without Him nothing is (created)] (Appendix, lines 553–54). Following these lines, a
          single verse in the Anglo-Norman poem has troubled modern editors and translators, who
          have not arrived at any consensus in translating the line: “Kar defaute n’est pas fet”
          [Indeed sin (default) is not created] (Appendix, line 555). R. F. Weymouth translates the
          line as “for it [i.e., creation] was not made defective (or, faulty).”<note target="#161"
            type="footnotelink">161</note> In contrast, Mackie offers a different interpretation:
          “Now sin was not created.”<note target="#162" type="footnotelink">162</note> Boulton in
          turn presents yet another possibility: “for he was not created in sin,” clarifying this to
          mean “when he became man, Jesus was free of all sin, unlike all other humans who are born
          with original sin.”<note target="#163" type="footnotelink">163</note> The range of
          translations illustrates the struggle a translator faces when interpreting this line. The
          challenge arises out of the difficulties in understanding what is meant by the word
          “defaute” in the Anglo-Norman poem, as well as in interpreting how the word is being used.
          The <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Norman Dictionary</hi> entry for <hi rend="italic"
            >defaute</hi> (n.) includes the senses “lack, shortage; need, want”; “error, mistake;
          fault, defect”; and “failure; failure to attend; default, failure to answer a
            summons.”<note target="#164" type="footnotelink">164</note> Most pertinent here is the
          legal meaning of “defaute” as a failure to appear in court in answer to a summons because
          the narrator already explained earlier that sin is equivalent to a legal default, as
          discussed above (see pp. 20–21). In the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>, “defaute” is thus
          freighted, since it encompasses a wide range of meanings: the definitions given in the
          poem — sin and legal default (i.e., absence from court) — alongside other meanings already
          implicit in the word, such as lack, error, imperfection, and so on.</p>
        <p style="body" n="42">The translator of the Middle English poem resolves these challenges
          through an expansion of that single line into three lines, an amplification that reveals
          the sophistication of the translator’s insights into the Anglo-Norman verse, even as
          modern editors and translators have struggled to make sense of it. At the end of the
          translation of the passage about the marvelous child (lines 645–50), the subsequent three
          lines in <hi rend="italic">The Castle of</hi><hi rend="italic"> Love</hi> translate the
          single line 555 from the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> (“Him” refers to Jesus): “And
          withouten Him is synne evere, / For wone dude He nevere, / Ne no schaft thorw Him mihte
          lees” [And sin is always outside Him, / For He never committed default (or, made a
          mistake; or, caused an imperfection / a lack / an omission), / And no creature might be
          dispossessed through Him] (lines 651–53). These three lines resolve the potential
          translation challenge by unpacking the word “defaute” from the Anglo-Norman poem into its
          various connotations, as the three lines evoke several meanings of the word from the
          source poem. In particular, the movement from the concepts of <hi rend="italic">sin</hi>
          to <hi rend="italic">default</hi> to <hi rend="italic">dispossession</hi> in the lines
          suggests not only the range of meanings the word “defaute” conveys in the single line from
          the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> but also a progression in which the presence of sin
          would cause default, which would in turn lead to dispossession.</p>
        <p style="body" n="43">By deliberately including in the three lines of the translation a
          range of ideas about sin, mistakes, imperfection, lack, and being dispossessed of property
          or inheritance because of a legal default, the English translator in fact demonstrates a
          deep understanding of both the implications contained in the Anglo-Norman word and the
          difficulties presented by the line and its possible interpretations. The use of “wone” to
          translate “defaute” encompasses a similarly wide range of meanings: mistake, imperfection,
          lack, or omission, in addition to “lack of conformity to a law or legal requirement,
          transgression, fault.”<note target="#165" type="footnotelink">165</note> The use of this
          Middle English word reveals a nuanced sense of the Anglo-Norman poem: “wone”
          simultaneously replicates the density of “defaute,” even as the medieval translator parses
          for the English-reading and -listening audiences the meaning of the original verse by
          turning the single line into three. Perhaps the difference between excluding some ideas
          and expanding on others has to do with the interests of the translator’s audience, who
          might find points of English law — and the courtroom drama the poem portrays — more
          relevant than the “new and highly controversial,” as well as technical and philosophical,
          ideas of <hi rend="italic">natura naturans</hi> and <hi rend="italic">natura
            naturata</hi>.<note target="#166" type="footnotelink">166</note></p>
        <p style="heading" n="10">Popularity and Influences on Later Works</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="11">Grosseteste’s Anglo-Norman <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> was

          the poem’s frequent grouping with other popular works and its appearance in manuscripts

          of being prepared by clerics for a wealthy household.<note target="#168"
            type="footnotelink">168</note> Grosseteste himself was a popular figure with brand-name
          recognition, which made him appealing to bookmakers because he was a prestigious and
          authoritative ecclesiastic, who nevertheless chose to write in the Anglo-Norman
            vernacular.<note target="#169" type="footnotelink">169</note> Grosseteste consequently
          had a number of works falsely attributed to him<note target="#170" type="footnotelink"

        <p style="body" n="44">In addition to the extant copies of the Anglo-Norman poem, four
          Middle English translations survive. <hi rend="italic">The Castle of Love</hi>, edited
          here, is the translation closest to the Anglo-Norman poem and survives in three
          manuscripts (discussed below; see pp. 29–34). The fifteenth-century <hi rend="italic"
            >Myrour </hi><hi rend="italic">of Lewed Men</hi> is the only translation besides <hi
            rend="italic">The Castle </hi><hi rend="italic">of Love</hi> that preserves the overall

          has been translated much more loosely.<note target="#172" type="footnotelink">172</note>
          The other two focus only on the allegory of the Four Daughters of God, a particularly
          popular element from Grosseteste’s poem. These shorter Middle English poems are “The King
          and His Four Daughters”<note target="#173" type="footnotelink">173</note> and the
          incomplete “Foure Daughters.”<note target="#174" type="footnotelink">174</note> The four

            type="footnotelink">175</note> The repeated interest in providing Middle English
          adaptations illustrates the popularity of the Anglo-Norman poem while acknowledging the
          difficulties of access to Anglo-Norman by the late fourteenth and early fifteenth

          adding “French” to a list of inaccessible languages (Latin, Hebrew, and Greek).<note
            target="#176" type="footnotelink">176</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="45">In addition, there are a number of medieval French poems based on the
            <hi rend="italic">Chasteau d’amour</hi> that also center on the Four Daughters’
            debate.<note target="#177" type="footnotelink">177</note> The allegory likewise appears
          in later Middle English works, including the <hi rend="italic">Cursor Mundi</hi> [<hi
            rend="italic">Runner of the World</hi>], a biblical paraphrase that incorporates some
          passages translated from the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau d’amour</hi>; the <hi
            rend="italic">Gesta Romanorum</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Deeds of the Romans</hi>], a
          popular collection of tales in Latin; Langland’s <hi rend="italic">Piers Plowman</hi>, an
          allegorical dream vision; <hi rend="italic">The Court of Sapience</hi>, a dream vision
          that is a kind of allegorical proto-encyclopedia; <hi rend="italic">The Castle of
            Perseverance</hi>, a late-medieval morality play where the Four Daughters of God appear
          as characters who debate Mankind’s salvation; <hi rend="italic">Mankind</hi>, another
          late-medieval morality play; and <hi rend="italic">Ludus Coventriae</hi>, the N-Town
          mystery cycle plays. The allegory also possibly influenced the Tale of Telaphus and Teucer
          from book 3 of John Gower’s <hi rend="italic">Confessio Amantis</hi> [<hi rend="italic"
            >The Lover’s Confession</hi>].<note target="#178" type="footnotelink">178</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="46">The Castle of Love was also a popular concept, but the specific
          influences of Grosseteste’s work are harder to trace and perhaps impossible to prove
          because the concept was already commonplace when Grosseteste adapted it. Sajavaara points
          out that the motif of the castle of the body and the idea of Jesus entering the Virgin
          Mary’s castle-body were prevalent in the homiletic tradition, making Grosseteste’s
          particular influence unclear.<note target="#179" type="footnotelink">179</note> Wheatley
          likewise acknowledges the difficulty in identifying Grosseteste’s impact with any
          precision but notes that “later developments in the Castle of Love certainly show the
          popularity of the motif and demonstrate that, by the later Middle Ages, it had become far
          more widespread and had many modes of application, both serious and lighthearted in
            intent.”<note target="#180" type="footnotelink">180</note> The Castle of Love motif also
          had secular interpretations where the Castle of Love could be an allegory for the lady’s
          heart or virginity, and the motif involved a siege,<note target="#181" type="footnotelink"
            >181</note> something Grosseteste’s poem only alludes to in the moment when the narrator
          knocks at the gate pleading for the Virgin Mary to let him in so he can escape the World,
          the Flesh, and the Devil. This <hi rend="italic">fin </hi><hi rend="italic">amor</hi>
          tradition appeared in pageants that included a mock siege of a Castle of Love, first
          documented in Treviso, Italy (1214), as well as portrayals of such sieges on
          early-fourteenth-century ivory caskets and decorative mirror cases.<note target="#182"
            type="footnotelink">182</note> Other forms included tapestries, manuscript
          illuminations, and table decor.<note target="#183" type="footnotelink">183</note>
          Sajavaara suggests it is impossible to say definitively how much influence Grosseteste’s
          allegory specifically had, but that its “direct influence . . . must have been rather
            small.”<note target="#184" type="footnotelink">184</note> Wheatley notes scholars’
          unanimous dismissal of connections to Grosseteste in these traditions but argues for
          evidence of mutual interchanges between “descendants” of Grosseteste’s allegory and the
          pageant in Treviso.<note target="#185" type="footnotelink">185</note> For example, similar
          siege-of-the-castle scenes are depicted in some English religious manuscripts such as the
            <hi rend="italic">Peterborough Psalter</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Luttrell </hi><hi
            rend="italic">Psalter</hi>, which Roger Sherman Loomis claims show the particular
          influence of secularly themed mirror cases and “must have diverted the thoughts of many a
          worldly reader from his devotions, if indeed they were not put there for that very
            purpose.”<note target="#186" type="footnotelink">186</note> Wheatley argues, however,
          that the siege illumination in the <hi rend="italic">Luttrell Psalter</hi> should be
          interpreted in relation to the text of the psalter and notes a specific parallel with the
          moment in Grosseteste’s poem when the narrator knocks on the gate, as the illumination in
          the <hi rend="italic">Luttrell Psalter</hi> sidelines the usual siege machinery in favor
          of a lone knight whose “left hand is raised in a fist, and [who] seems to be knocking on
          the door of the castle.”<note target="#187" type="footnotelink">187</note> Arguably, <hi
            rend="italic">The Castle of Perseverance</hi>, whose use of the Four Daughters of God
          allegory is mentioned above (see pp. 13–14), likewise shows the influence of Grosseteste’s
          Castle of Love allegory, as within the Castle of Perseverance, Mankind is besieged by the
          World, the Flesh, and the Devil, like the narrator in Grosseteste’s poem who asks Mary to
          save him from these traditional enemies. Loomis notes a fourteenth-century casket with a
          different “ecclesiastical version of the Siege motif,” as “the castle is surmounted by a
          church, and the battlements are held by nuns” who “hurl down white pellets on the powers
          of the world represented by six gaily clad youths mounting upon ladders to the
            assault.”<note target="#188" type="footnotelink">188</note> These examples illustrate
          the difficulty in definitively separating the allegory’s secular and religious
          threads.</p>
        <p style="body" n="47">Regardless of its connections with other well-known traditions, the
          poem draws on popular oral storytelling tropes, such as direct appeals to the audience to
          listen, that recall the practices of live performances. Some of these are brief, a single
          line or part of a line, as for example, “Lustneth to me, lordynges” (line 91), “as I er
          tolde” (line 157), or “Lusteneth yet forther” (line 1515). Others are more elaborate, such
          as when the narrator offers the following rhetorical scenario in which a hypothetical
          question is posited that the narrator will then answer:</p>

        <p style="bodysubsection" n="3">Based on similar rhetorical flourishes in the Anglo-Norman
          poem, Southern suggests the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> was meant to be recited aloud
          or even sung, but it is hard to say definitively, as such appeals were commonplace in
          popular tales of all types and may simply have been rhetorical flourishes meant to recall
          oral storytelling.<note target="#189" type="footnotelink">189</note> Reading aloud was
          popular from the twelfth through the fourteenth centuries, as were recitations from memory
          and other performances.<note target="#190" type="footnotelink">190</note> As Nancy Mason
          Bradbury explains, “A given story might in the course of its career be read privately by
          an educated individual, read aloud from manuscripts by members of the household to their
          social equals, and both read aloud and recited from memory by professional performers,
          both to their social superiors in banquet halls and to their equals in taverns and
            marketplaces.”<note target="#191" type="footnotelink">191</note> The elaborate
          presentation of the Vernon manuscript, described below (see pp. 31–33), nevertheless
          emphasizes its visual appeal — its significance as an object to be seen — thus signaling
          the value placed on its visual consumption.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="11">The Manuscripts</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="12">The Middle English <hi rend="italic">Castle of Love</hi>
          survives in three manuscripts: Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Eng. poet. a. 1, known as the
          Vernon manuscript (ca. 1390–1400); London, British Library, MS Additional 22283, known as
          the Simeon manuscript (ca. 1400); and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Additional B. 107 (ca.
          1425–50). The copies of the poem in Vernon and Simeon both leave the poem unfinished,
          appending a conclusion of twelve lines after line 1514. The third manuscript, MS
          Additional B. 107, called H in this volume, contains a more complete version of the poem,
          though due to a missing leaf, H lacks the lines at the end that would correspond to the
          final twelve lines in the Anglo-Norman source poem.<note target="#192" type="footnotelink"
            >192</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="48">I use H as the base text for the lines missing from the end of the
          poem in Vernon and Simeon (lines 1515–1862), but I did not find it suitable as the source
          for the complete poem for several reasons. First, the poem in H appears to be a later
          version, farther from the original translation. There are hundreds of revisions resulting
          from the desire to modernize the text or because words were unknown or simply
            old-fashioned.<note target="#193" type="footnotelink">193</note> Likewise, there are
          frequent changes in word order and the addition of words to fix the meter due to the loss
          of the pronunciation of final -<hi rend="italic">e</hi>.<note target="#194"
            type="footnotelink">194</note> Second, the overall quality of H’s text is lower in the
          portion overlapping with the Vernon and Simeon copies. H is missing a number of lines,
          including a fairly long passage of forty lines (lines 1235–74) that was unintentionally
          omitted, as well as some garbled passages because of the scribe’s evident misunderstanding
          of the exemplar at various points.<note target="#195" type="footnotelink">195</note>
          Third, damage to the first three leaves means that many parts of lines 8–112 are now
            illegible.<note target="#196" type="footnotelink">196</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="49">Collation of variants from the Vernon and Simeon manuscripts shows
          that, although these versions of the poem are very close, they are not identical, despite
          being copied by the same scribe at roughly the same time.<note target="#197"
            type="footnotelink">197</note> Where the two manuscripts diverge, Vernon has better
          readings in almost all cases.<note target="#198" type="footnotelink">198</note> Moreover,
          the copy in the Simeon manuscript omits a few lines that the Vernon copy includes, some
          based on the Anglo-Norman poem and others apparently added by the translator.<note
            target="#199" type="footnotelink">199</note> Thus, for lines 1–1514 of the poem I use
          the Vernon manuscript as the base text.</p>
        <p style="body" n="50">The portion of the poem elided in Vernon and Simeon includes the
          section describing the events leading up to the Last Judgment (based on <hi rend="italic"
            >The Fifteen Signs Before Doomsday</hi>, as mentioned above; see p. 12); the Last
          Judgment of the dead and the division of the saved and the damned into heaven and hell,
          respectively; and the visions of hell and heaven. There are two possibilities to explain
          the missing lines: either the exemplar used for copying the manuscripts was incomplete or
          the omission was deliberate. The twelve-line conclusion (given in the textual note to line
          1514) appended to the poem’s end could imply the omission was intentional, yet the scribe
          might have composed a boilerplate conclusion if the exemplar were defective. Of particular
          interest is that the twelve concluding lines from the Vernon and Simeon copies of <hi
            rend="italic">The Castle of Love</hi> have enough echoes with the final four lines of
          the Anglo-Norman poem to suggest they may have been a loose translation of these
            lines.<note target="#200" type="footnotelink">200</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="51">The closely related Vernon and Simeon manuscripts “are the largest
          known collective volumes of Middle English verse and prose, both physically and in number
          of contents.”<note target="#201" type="footnotelink">201</note> They are nevertheless not
          unique but exist rather within “a tradition of ‘massy’, collective vernacular book
            production.”<note target="#202" type="footnotelink">202</note> The Vernon manuscript’s
          size and weight illustrate just how difficult it would have been to manage physically. The
          manuscript weighs 22 kilograms (about 48.75 pounds), with 350 leaves remaining of its
          probable 422 or 426 original leaves, which are each 544 × 393 mm (about 21.5 × 15.5
            inches).<note target="#203" type="footnotelink">203</note> Simeon was even larger at 585
          × 400 mm<note target="#204" type="footnotelink">204</note> (about 23 × 15.75 inches).
          Vernon and Simeon would have been extremely expensive to produce, given the quantity and
          quality of the vellum and other materials used in their composition.<note target="#205"
            type="footnotelink">205</note> Most likely both books would have required “a lectern
          desk or table” to support them.<note target="#206" type="footnotelink">206</note> The
          Vernon and Simeon manuscripts are both available for viewing online as digital facsimiles,
          and it is well worth examining these manuscripts in high resolution to get a sense of what
          the medieval readers of these massive books would have seen.<note target="#207"

          depending on the length of the lines being copied (two for prose or longer verse lines vs.

          between angels with censers with a monk in white habit kneeling in front, holding a

          comprises heavy wooden boards, possibly medieval, covered in the nineteenth century with
          tooled leather, and “sewn on six double spine supports of cord, in the position of
          medieval thongs.”<note target="#212" type="footnotelink">212</note></p>

          It was copied by two scribes, designated Scribe A and Scribe B. Most of the copying was
          done by Scribe B (also responsible for much of the Simeon manuscript), who wrote in an
          Anglicana script characteristic of the mid-fourteenth century and therefore outdated by
          the time the manuscript was copied near the end of the century.<note target="#214"
            type="footnotelink">214</note> Because Scribe B’s hand is so regular and consistent and

          <hi rend="italic">The Castle </hi><hi rend="italic">of Love</hi> is the only work in the
          manuscript, which consists of forty-six vellum leaves arranged in four quires ranging from
          ten to twelve leaves, with one or more leaves missing at the end of the manuscript,
          leaving the poem unfinished. Folio 46r is the back pastedown, with a modern note in pencil
          that says, “An exceedingly rare MS, only one other copy of wch. is known to exist, but the
          present containing a superior text. The last leaf is wanting &amp; the first few leaves
          are slightly discoloured by galls, but otherwise the MS is in a fine &amp; perfect
          co[ndi]tion. Wharton has mentioned [t]he copy in the celebrated Ve[rnon] MS no other being
          k[nown] [to] him. Note by Halli[we]ll,” and below this is written in brackets, “[an

          which I am unable to decipher.</p>
        <p style="body" n="59">The poem is written by a single scribe in a regular Anglicana hand in
          one column, usually of twenty lines (though ranging from eighteen to twenty-two), and
          couplets are bracketed in red ink in the right margin; the numbering is modern
            pencil.<note target="#235" type="footnotelink">235</note> The current binding is early
          though not medieval (after 1520) and consists of “plain white parchment with marks of

          “[s]ewn with four white leather thongs, probably in their original positions.”<note

          Orchard Halliwell first edited the manuscript in the mid-nineteenth century (1849), he

        <p style="heading" n="12">Previous Editions and Scholarship</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="13">Nineteenth-century scholars focused mainly on making the poem
          accessible through editions of the Anglo-Norman and Middle English poems. The earliest
          edition of the Anglo-Norman poem was produced by M. Cooke in 1852 under the title <hi
            rend="italic">Carmen de creatione Mundi</hi>. Cooke also includes in his volume a poem
          called the <hi rend="italic">Vie de Sainte Marie Egyptienne</hi> and one of the Middle
          English translations of the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi
            rend="italic"> Myrour of Lewed Men</hi>, which he titles <hi rend="italic">The Romance
            of</hi><hi rend="italic"> Chasteau D’amour</hi>. Cooke offers minimal context for his
          texts in the form of a preface that contains a few details about Grosseteste’s life and
          works and identifies the manuscripts used to produce the volume. There are no textual or
          explanatory notes. Later scholars criticized Cooke’s edition of the Anglo-Norman poem as
          flawed due to inaccuracies.<note target="#239" type="footnotelink">239</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="60">The earliest edition of the Middle English <hi rend="italic">Castle
            of Love</hi> is Halliwell’s 1849 limited printing of the poem based on H. This edition
          is not lineated, emendations are not noted, and Halliwell supplied without noting them the
          missing or illegible lines from Vernon, including the long passage consisting of lines
            1235–74.<note target="#240" type="footnotelink">240</note> The edition by R. F.
          Weymouth, published in 1864, is not reader-friendly for present-day audiences. It does not
          modernize the letterforms and reproduces the abbreviations rather than expanding them. The
          edition has only a brief preface that discusses editorial practices but nothing more, as
          the introduction was published separately as a journal article.<note target="#241"
            type="footnotelink">241</note> There are a few explanatory notes mixed in with the
          textual notes, but these are geared toward scholars rather than students. The collation of
          variants in the textual notes is incomplete. There is a brief glossary. Weymouth’s edition
          presents the Vernon manuscript’s version of the poem, which, like that in Simeon, includes
          only the first 1514 lines plus a twelve-line conclusion. The edition by Carl Horstmann
          with marginal notes by F. J. Furnivall, published in 1892, likewise presents the text of
          Vernon, recording in a separate section the variants from H, as well as the end of the
          poem, but these are supplied from Halliwell’s edition rather than from the
            manuscript.<note target="#242" type="footnotelink">242</note> The text of the poem is
          presented without an introduction, and textual notes collated with Simeon are published in
          a separate volume.<note target="#243" type="footnotelink">243</note> The presentation of
          the poem includes some marginal notes suggesting corrected readings of words in the poem,
          detailing the topic of the poem at different points, and offering comparisons with the
          edition of the Anglo-Norman poem by Cooke,<note target="#244" type="footnotelink"
            >244</note> although there are no explanatory notes. The Horstmann-Furnivall edition
          does not modernize the letterforms but does expand abbreviations.</p>
        <p style="body" n="61">J. Murray’s 1918 edition of the Anglo-Norman text titled the poem <hi
            rend="italic">Le Château d’Amour</hi> and included a much more extensive editorial
          apparatus, with an introduction covering Grosseteste’s life and works, descriptions and
          classifications of the Anglo-Norman manuscripts, various linguistic aspects of the poem’s
          language (e.g., versification, phonology, pronunciation, syntax, morphology), the date of
          the poem, a summary of the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>, the poem’s sources, and its
          translations and influence. Murray’s edition also includes textual notes, a few
          explanatory notes, and a brief glossary.<note target="#245" type="footnotelink">245</note>
          In 2002 Evelyn Anne Mackie produced a modern edition for her Ph.D. dissertation, which
          includes examination of the manuscripts and their provenance; discussion of Grosseteste
          and the poem’s likely audience; analysis of the poem’s text, date, contemporary literary
          context, sources, and the allegories; textual notes; a brief glossary; and an appendix
          containing the Latin prologues.<note target="#246" type="footnotelink">246</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="62">The most recent edition of the Middle English poem is by Kari
          Sajavaara, published in 1967. This volume is very helpful for scholars but less so for
          students. It includes all four Middle English translations of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau d’amour</hi> and offers a wealth of information. The introduction has sections
          on Grosseteste’s life and works, various aspects of the Anglo-Norman <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau</hi>, and each of the four English translations or adaptations. Sajavaara’s
          extensive discussion of the Anglo-Norman poem includes sections detailing manuscripts and
          editions, authorship and date, a summary, and analyses of the general theme and the
          specific allegories of the Four Daughters of God and the Castle of Love. The volume
          includes introductions to each Middle English version that encompass relevant details of
          the manuscripts (including descriptions, provenance, language, and their interrelation and
          relative authority); discuss a given translation’s date, dialect, and authorship; and
          examine versification. The final portion of Sajavaara’s introduction addresses issues of
          translation, including the relation between the Anglo-Norman and the four Middle English
          poems, translation techniques, changes the translations make to the message of the poem,
          narrative or rhetorical devices used in translating, and the translators’ mistakes. In the
          editions of the poems, the letterforms are not modernized, and there are no marginal
          glosses (although there is a small glossary). The volume also includes textual and
          explanatory notes for each Middle English poem. Sajavaara provides the textual variants at
          the bottom of the page throughout the poem and provides an additional mixture of
          explanatory and textual notes toward the end of the volume. The notes detail biblical
          allusions, some historical and contextual information, and comparisons with the
          Anglo-Norman poem, as well as discussions of word use, emendations, and prosody. Although
          it is possible to borrow it in digital form from the <hi rend="italic">Internet
            Archive</hi>, a physical copy of the edition is difficult to access.<note target="#247"
            type="footnotelink">247</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="63">Early scholarship often explored sources, analogues, and influences,
          or comparisons between versions of the poem from different manuscripts. Weymouth’s “Bishop
          Grosseteste’s <hi rend="italic">Castle of Love</hi>” (1862), published separately from his
          edition of the <hi rend="italic">Castle</hi> (1864), identifies the Anglo-Norman poem as
          the source for the Middle English one but then focuses mainly on understanding the
          relation between copies of the <hi rend="italic">Castle of Love</hi> in the surviving
          manuscripts through an analysis of select passages. Hugo Haenisch’s dissertation (1884) on
          the <hi rend="italic">Cursor Mundi</hi> examines the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> as a
          source for parts of the <hi rend="italic">Cursor Mundi</hi> using side-by-side comparison
          of passages from the <hi rend="italic">Cursor</hi> with the <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau</hi>.<note target="#248" type="footnotelink">248</note> The deeper
          contextualization and the higher quality texts provided by the twentieth-century editions
          reinvigorated scholarly interest in the Anglo-Norman and Middle English poems, but much of
          the twentieth-century scholarship still centered on the preoccupations of sources,
          analogues, influences, and manuscript interrelation, as in Sister Mary Immaculate Creek’s
          dissertation, “The Sources and Influence of the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau d’Amour</hi>”
          (1941). Sajavaara explicitly extends Haenisch’s work by exploring additional passages that
          show the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>’s influence on the <hi rend="italic">Cursor
            Mundi</hi> in “The Use of Robert Grosseteste’s <hi rend="italic">Château d’amour</hi> as
          a Source of the <hi rend="italic">Cursor Mundi</hi>: Additional Evidence” (1967).</p>
        <p style="body" n="64">Two of the most fruitful strands of scholarship — both early and late
          — have explored the religious allegories of the Four Daughters of God and the Castle of
          Love, discussed in detail, above (see pp. 13–18). The initial works on these topics, like
          other early scholarship, focused on teasing out the origins of the allegories, discussing
          their changes over time, and exploring the relation between different sources and
          analogues. The first in-depth exploration of the Four Daughters of God allegory is Hope
          Traver’s study, <hi rend="italic">The Four Daughters of God</hi> (1907), which details the
          origin and evolution of the allegory through nine strands of its development. Traver
          includes a chapter on the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>, contextualizing it within a
          group of other works and exploring their interrelation. The focus of the discussion is not
          interpretive but rather seeks to identify the works from which Grosseteste’s poem borrowed
          and those the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> influenced in turn.<note target="#249"
            type="footnotelink">249</note> Building on Traver’s work, Creek’s later essay “The Four
          Daughters of God in the <hi rend="italic">Gesta Romanormum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
            >Court</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Sapience</hi>” (1942) explores the interrelation of
          several works containing the allegory, including Grosseteste’s <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau</hi>.<note target="#250" type="footnotelink">250</note> Mattias Tveitane
          continues the interest in sources and analogues in his discussion of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau</hi> as one possible source for the Old Norse didactic work the <hi
            rend="italic">King’s Mirror</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Speculum Regale</hi> / <hi
            rend="italic">Konungs skuggsjá</hi>) in “The ‘Four Daughters of God’ in the Old Norse
            <hi rend="italic">King’s Mirror</hi>” (1972).<note target="#251" type="footnotelink"
            >251</note> The seminal work on the Castle allegory is Roberta Douglas Cornelius’s Ph.D.
          dissertation, “The Figurative Castle” (1930). Within the larger study, Cornelius covers
          the history of the representation of Mary’s body as a castle in her chapter “The Blessed
          Virgin as a Castle,” where she contextualizes Grosseteste’s use of the allegory briefly
          within this chronology.<note target="#252" type="footnotelink">252</note> In “The ‘Castle
          of Love’ in English Folk-Songs,” Sajavaara examines the popularity of the motif of the
          Castle of Love in a number of ballads, acknowledging that “the similarity with Robert
          Grosseteste’s <hi rend="italic">Castle</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Love</hi> is only very
          vague” (1972).<note target="#253" type="footnotelink">253</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="65">Though later explorations of the allegories or other religious themes
          often maintain an interest in the influences of Grosseteste’s poem, the focus of this more
          recent scholarship is on understanding the interpretive implications for the later work.
          In <hi rend="italic">Poetry Does Theology: </hi><hi rend="italic">Chaucer, Grosseteste,
            and the Pearl-Poet</hi> (2001), for example, Jim Rhodes first explores how the <hi
            rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> reflects Grosseteste’s theology, especially in the Four
          Daughters allegory, and then examines in turn Langland’s use of the allegory and its
          theological implications in <hi rend="italic">Piers Plowman</hi>. Nicholas Watson’s
          “William Langland Reads Robert Grosseteste” (2017) analyzes <hi rend="italic">Piers
            Plowman</hi>’s “sense of its place in a continuing tradition of English pastoral
          literature,” exploring how the allegories of Mary’s body as the Castle and the Four
          Daughters of God, as well as the debate between Jesus and the Devil, reflect <hi
            rend="italic">Piers Plowman</hi>’s reception of theological ideas from Grosseteste’s
          poem, where we might see Langland “write around and even against the <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau</hi>.”<note target="#254" type="footnotelink">254</note> In <hi rend="italic"
            >Robert Grosseteste: The Growth of an English Mind </hi><hi rend="italic">in Medieval
            Europe</hi> (1992), R. W. Southern considers the poem primarily a pastoral work intended
          to explain complex theology for lay people, including the difficult concepts of <hi
            rend="italic">natura naturans</hi> (God as the creator) and <hi rend="italic">natura
            naturata</hi> (nature as the creation), discussed above (see pp. 22–25).<note

          concepts in his portrait of Kynde in <hi rend="italic">Piers Plowman</hi> shows the
          influence of Grosseteste’s theology from the Anglo-Norman poem.</p>
        <p style="body" n="66">The idea of the architectural allegory of the Castle of Love is
          likewise a productive one, explored by Jill Mann in “Allegorical Buildings in Mediaeval
          Literature,” where she examines a number of uses of allegorical structures,
          contextualizing Grosseteste’s among them.<note target="#257" type="footnotelink"
            >257</note> Several critics investigating the architectural motif of the Castle of Love
          as Mary’s body interpret the allegory in terms of what the poem suggests about Mary’s
          virginity. In <hi rend="italic">The </hi><hi rend="italic">Idea of the Castle in Medieval
            England</hi>, Abigail Wheatley enumerates biblical allusions in the <hi rend="italic"
            >Chasteau</hi>’s description of the Castle of Love and explores the implications of the

        <p style="body" n="67">Another important theological topic in recent scholarship is the
          poem’s treatment of the two theories of the “Devil’s rights,” of Christ as a ransom for
          Adam, and the Devil’s abuse of power, which I discuss above (see pp. 21–22). James McEvoy,
          Creek, and Sajavaara, respectively, see the poem combining the two theories,<note
            target="#264" type="footnotelink">264</note> but C. W. Marx makes a different case in
            <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic"> Devil’s Rights and the Redemption in the
            Literature of</hi><hi rend="italic"> Medieval England</hi>. Focusing on both the debate
          between Christ and the Devil and the courtroom arguments of the Four Daughters of God,
          Marx explores how Grosseteste treats this issue in the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>
          through the lens of his <hi rend="italic">Dictum 10</hi>.<note target="#265"
            type="footnotelink">265</note> There, Grosseteste “describes Christ as a ‘buyer’ who
          bought the human race from God and the Devil,” but his theory of ransom differs from that
          of “Gregory of Nyssa[,] where the ransom is paid to the Devil and no mention is made of
          payment to God”; rather, Grosseteste holds that payment for releasing the prisoner “must
          be made to the king (God) not the jailer (the Devil).”<note target="#266"
            type="footnotelink">266</note> In the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>’s debate between
          Christ and the Devil, Marx suggests that “Grosseteste has modernized this picture of the
          defeat of the Devil by showing that the Devil had no right over humanity.”<note
            target="#267" type="footnotelink">267</note> In the Four Daughters of God episode,
          likewise “[t]he ransom is not to be paid to the torturer (the Devil) but to the king, and
          the king’s son does not say that he will pay a ransom to the jailer but that he will
          suffer the judgement of death, in place of the prisoner, in order to reconcile the
          dictates of justice with mercy,” and “[u]ltimately the Devil is irrelevant to the
            redemption.”<note target="#268" type="footnotelink">268</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="68">Other recent scholars examine the manuscript tradition, gleaning
          information about audiences, book production, and ownership through the extant physical
          copies (in contrast to earlier manuscript work, such as Weymouth’s, that focused on the
          relation between copies of the poem). In the opening to her translation into Modern
          English of the Anglo-Norman version of the poem, Mackie uses the surviving copies of the
          work, as well as medieval library inventories, to hypothesize about the audiences of the
            poem.<note target="#269" type="footnotelink">269</note> Mackie’s essay “Scribal
          Intervention and the Question of Audience” also identifies ways that scribal “editing” in

          Siebach-Larsen then brings the threads of Grosseteste’s theological messaging and
          manuscript production of his work together in her essay “Structures of Thought in Robert
          Grosseteste’s <hi rend="italic">Chasteau d’amour</hi> and the Tateshal Miscellany.”
          Siebach-Larsen analyzes the presentation of a manuscript owned by Joan Tateshal to

          a manuscript’s patron in relation to the work being commissioned.<note target="#273"

          text, going so far as to have herself painted into the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>’s

          the poem’s transformative action of salvation as both patron and audience.<note

        <p style="body" n="69">Mackie and Maureen B. M. Boulton, respectively, offer Modern English
          prose translations of the Anglo-Norman poem. Although these translations have helped make
          the poem somewhat accessible to broader audiences, the poem’s relative obscurity continues
          to make teaching the work impractical and scholarship on it challenging. This new edition
          thus aims to offer more to present-day audiences of students, teachers, and scholars
          alike. The features that help readers include generous marginal glosses in the Middle
          English poem and explanatory notes geared toward students; an Appendix with the
          Anglo-Norman text, together with a facing-page verse translation; and ample textual notes
          to both poems for scholars.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="13">Editorial Practices</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="14">I have edited the poem according to the standard METS practices
          of following modern rules for capitalization, punctuation, and word division. I silently
          expand scribal abbreviations, regularize the spelling of <hi rend="italic">i/j</hi> and
            <hi rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="italic">/v</hi>, change <hi rend="italic">ff</hi> to
            <hi rend="italic">F</hi> or <hi rend="italic">f</hi> where applicable, modernize the
          archaic letterforms thorn (<hi rend="italic">þ</hi> &gt; <hi rend="italic">th</hi>) and
          yogh (<hi rend="italic">ȝ</hi> &gt; <hi rend="italic">g</hi>, <hi rend="italic">gh</hi>,
            <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, <hi rend="italic">y</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">z</hi>, as
          appropriate), and change <hi rend="italic">þe</hi> to <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> when the
          meaning is “you.” Words that begin with <hi rend="italic">I</hi> followed by a punctus are
          written without a space or hyphen, following modern editorial practice (e.g., <hi
            rend="italic">ichulle</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ihud</hi>, <hi rend="italic">isome</hi>).
          As is common with many fifteenth-century hands, the scribe of H uses a number of strokes
          that I disregard as otiose, including flourishes on some final letters (-<hi rend="italic"
            >d</hi>, -<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, -<hi rend="italic">n</hi>), as well as barred <hi
            rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ll</hi>. I expand the loop on the letter <hi
            rend="italic">r</hi> in both medial and final position to -<hi rend="italic">e</hi>,
          however, which Sajavaara did not.<note target="#276" type="footnotelink">276</note>
          Variant readings in the Textual Notes retain their original letterforms, although scribal
          abbreviations are still expanded. Throughout the poem, I note folio numbers in the margin.
          In most cases, the line breaks I add in the poem immediately precede decorated initials as
          they occur in the Vernon manuscript until line 1514, after which I follow H. In the first
          1514 lines, I also note marginalia from Vernon, such as notes for exempla, in the Textual
          Notes.</p>
        <p style="body" n="70">The Textual Notes record emendations and note variants among the
          three manuscripts, as well as describe decorated initials and paraph marks or pilcrows (¶)
          in the base manuscript (V or H). In addition, damage and staining in H renders portions of
          some lines illegible (particularly on the first several folios), and I note wherever there
          are lacunae. The Textual Notes do not record spelling variations between manuscripts
          except when catchwords or -phrases are already cited to note more significant differences.
          Previous editors’ brackets indicating their insertions or changes have been silently
          elided when noting their emendations. I emend when necessary for sense or when evidence
          points to an obvious omission or change, but I do not attempt to correct meter or line
          length. In creating a hybrid of the texts in Vernon and H, I am not presenting something
          close to an actual surviving copy; my goal is to offer modern readers the best version of
          as complete a poem as I can.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="14">A Note on the Appendix</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="15">I include the <hi rend="italic">Chasteau d’amour</hi> together
          with a facing-page translation in this volume to enable easy comparison between the Middle
          English and Anglo-Norman versions of the poem. My verse translation is relatively literal
          and matches the Anglo-Norman line by line. This sometimes makes for awkward syntax in
          Modern English, but sticking close to the original assists readers who want to use the
          Anglo-Norman text but may not be familiar with the dialect or medieval French more
          generally. The Anglo-Norman poem survives in eighteen manuscripts,<note target="#277"
            type="footnotelink">277</note> which can be divided into two groups, one of which is
          more closely related to the Middle English translation.<note target="#278"
            type="footnotelink">278</note> Of this stemma, three manuscripts stand out as most
          useful to this volume: Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 399 (1300), referred to as B;
          Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 652 (second half of thirteenth century), identified as
          O; and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Laud Misc. 471B (ca. 1300), here called L.<note
            target="#279" type="footnotelink">279</note> Although none of the surviving copies could
          have supplied the translator’s exemplar, it probably came from the stemma that includes
          these manuscripts.<note target="#280" type="footnotelink">280</note> In this grouping, B
          and L are the best texts, but B has fewer intentional changes, its variations due more to
          scribal errors.<note target="#281" type="footnotelink">281</note> The versions in B and O
          are closely related to one another, but B is a better copy than O, with fewer errors and
          missing lines, and I thus use B as my base text. Although B and O are nearer the earlier
          stemma than L, they nevertheless leave out some lines that the translator used.<note
            target="#282" type="footnotelink">282</note> As the most reliable of the remaining
          copies in the stemma, L is useful for supplying missing lines and corrections.</p>
        <p style="body" n="71">Bodley 399 (MS B) is an English manuscript containing 124 leaves (vi
          + 118 fols.) of 247 × 170 mm (about 9.75 × 6.7 inches), written in two columns of
          thirty-seven to thirty-eight lines with some decorated initials and rubrics. It was copied
          by two scribes, one who wrote folios 1–31v, and a second who copied folios 32–116v. Except
          for some brief theological notes in Latin on folios 116r (after the end of the <hi
            rend="italic">Chasteau</hi>) and 117r, all the works are in Anglo-Norman.<note
            target="#283" type="footnotelink">283</note> The manuscript contains seventeen quires,
          mostly eight leaves apiece (the first and the fifteenth have six, the second has one, the
          ninth has nine, and the seventeenth has four), plus a smaller fragment, folio 118 (glued
          to folio 117). It has rubrics, running titles, and some catchwords, and the decoration
          consists of alternating red and blue initials with penwork flourishes.<note target="#284"
            type="footnotelink">284</note> The binding of the manuscript, though old, does not
          appear to be original; the boards are made of cardboard covered in light brown leather
          with darker speckles throughout. The decoration of the binding includes a fine double line
          impressed around the outside of both front and back boards, crossing in the corners, with
          cold-stamped leaf and floral details (much better preserved on the front) running
          vertically along the edges next to the spine. The portion of the manuscript containing the
            <hi rend="italic">Chasteau</hi> was copied by the second scribe in a careful and regular
          English bookhand. The poem begins with a five-line initial <hi rend="italic">K</hi> in
          dark blue, elaborately decorated in blue, red, and yellow and embellished with penwork
          flourishes within the letter that also extend across the top of the page and down the left
          margin an additional eight lines. Interspersed throughout the remainder of the poem are
          two-line decorated initials alternating between blue embellished with red penwork and red
          embellished with blue penwork (some also with light brown or yellow accents); the penwork
          flourishes decorate the space within the letters and extend up and down the left margins.
          In addition to theological notes, there is a record of payment in a sixteenth-century hand
          on folio 116r: “Follar hawe resywed of hes wages for this quartar the xx of july iis id”
          (i.e., 2 shillings, 1 penny). Folios 116v–117r also contain a number of pen trials,
          including the notation “In my beginning” on folio 116v. A notation at the top of folio
          115v reads “Concede nos <hi rend="italic">famulorum</hi>” [Grant our <hi rend="italic"
            >famulorum</hi>].<note target="#285" type="footnotelink">285</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="72">Taylor suggests that Bodley 399 may have been produced like other
          collections of vernacular texts as part of the commercial book trade; rather than a
          “bespoke” manuscript, readers might request “an elegant collection of fashionable and
          varied material by making a personal selection of pre-copied fascicles.”<note

          Pierre d’Abernon (also known as Pierre de Peckham of Fetcham), an Anglo-Norman didactic
          religious poem of 13,960 lines that covers a range of theological topics and survives in
          twenty copies (some fragmentary).<note target="#288" type="footnotelink">288</note> Rauf

          Next comes Grosseteste’s <hi rend="italic">Chasteau d’amour</hi>, followed by what was

        <p style="body" n="73">The editorial practices for the Anglo-Norman text are substantially
          the same as noted for the Middle English poem earlier in this Introduction. I regularize
          the spelling of <hi rend="italic">i/</hi><hi rend="italic">j</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
            >u/v</hi>; silently expand abbreviations; and follow modern rules for capitalization,
          punctuation, and word division. In addition, I have added diacritics where appropriate:
          the acute accent on <hi rend="italic">é</hi>; the diaeresis (French <hi rend="italic"
            >tréma</hi>) on <hi rend="italic">ï</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ÿ</hi>, <hi rend="italic"

            >Chasteau</hi> with L, as well as with Murray’s early-twentieth-century edition, which
          is based on a manuscript from the group less closely related to the English poem. Although
          I consulted O, I do not include it in the Textual Notes, as most differences with B are
          errors or misreadings. I have included Murray’s edition because it is the text scholars
          have long quoted and relied on for the Anglo-Norman poem, and it will be helpful to note
          the differences between that edition and the text in this volume.<note target="#294"
            type="footnotelink">294</note> I emend when necessary for sense or when evidence points
          to an obvious omission or change. The scribe of B usually expunges words and letters by
          writing dots below what should be deleted; in the Textual Notes, these are marked with the
          strikeout feature, as with other cancellations (except in cases where a single minim is
          expunged). As with the Middle English poem, variant readings in the Textual Notes retain
          their original letterforms, and scribal abbreviations are silently expanded. I note
          decorated initials and paraph marks or pilcrows (¶) where they occur in B. Notes are not
          included specifically to record variations in spelling or for variants between <hi

          that story continued and encompasses the full history of God’s chosen people as narrated
          in the Old Testament and as it came to its temporal fulfillment in the New Testament. But

          put anchorites “in the center of village life,” since “at least some anchorholds, it
