        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>

          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in
            order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and

              . mennes byhove</hi>. The four-line incipit, though not part of the poem, is an
            adjunct to the poem’s prologue section in that it identifies the source of the poem and
            gives it a title. The incipit is a quatrain rhyming <hi rend="italic">abab</hi>, as
            distinct from the poem, which is in rhyming couplets. (For discussion of the poem’s
            title, see the section Title of the Poem in the Introduction to this volume, pp. 3–4.)
            Dearnley’s study <hi rend="italic">Translators and </hi><hi rend="italic">Their
              Prologues in Medieval England</hi> offers a detailed analysis of prologues in English
            translations, including a chapter focused on the four ME adaptations of the AN <hi
              rend="italic">Chasteau d’amour</hi> to understand the development of prologues from
            French to English (pp. 63–96). Dearnley identifies eleven discrete tropes used in
            English prologues, including that of identifying sources, used here (p. 64). Prologues
            to English works in general (not just translators’ prologues) molded perceptions of the
            vernacular (for more on this topic, see explanatory note to lines 35–38, below); for
            examples and analysis of prologues from numerous medieval English works dating from 1280
            to 1520, see the anthology edited by Wogan-Browne and colleagues, <hi rend="italic">The

              >God art and Thrillihod / And threo Persones in onhod</hi> (repeated in variations
            throughout the poem) may be a direct allusion to lines from the Athanasian Creed: “unum
            Deum in Trinitate, et Trinitatem in unitate veneremur” [we worship one God in Trinity,
            and Trinity in unity] (ed. and trans. Schaff, <hi rend="italic">Greek </hi><hi
              rend="italic">and Latin Creeds</hi>, p. 66, no. 3). Grosseteste’s language in <hi
              rend="italic">Dictum 60</hi> is similar, where he asserts that “the smallest and most
            insignificant object in the universe, a speck of dust” might be understood as “a mirror
            of the Creator in its unity and trinity” (trans. Southern, p. 216; see also Grosseteste,
            “Grosseteste’s <hi rend="italic">Dicta</hi>,” ed. Westermann and Goering, <hi
              rend="italic">Ordered Universe</hi>). Such Trinitarian statements stand against
            heresies that denied Christ’s divinity (see explanatory note to lines 559–60, below), as
            well as against those that were concerned with the unity of God and explicitly denied
            the Trinity. These included Adoptionism or Dynamic Monarchianism (which also denied
            Christ’s divinity) and Sabellianism, which held that God was not three Persons in one
            but rather “revealed himself in three ways, or modes” in succession (Boer, <hi
              rend="italic">Short History of the Early Church</hi>, p. 112). Augustine’s treatise on
            the topic, <hi rend="italic">De Trinitate</hi>, was influential in the Middle Ages (see
            Augustine, <hi rend="italic">Trinity</hi>, trans. McKenna; Augustine, <hi rend="italic"
              >On the Trinity</hi>, ed. Matthews, trans. McKenna; Ayres, <hi rend="italic">Augustine
              and the Trinity</hi>). The doctrine of the Trinity was an important topic among
            medieval theologians; for example, Thomas Aquinas, writing some thirty or forty years
            after the probable composition date of <hi rend="italic">Le chasteau d’amour</hi> (but a
            century or more before the surviving ME adaptations), discusses the Trinity in <hi

            guard the soul (see Cornelius’s chapter, “The Castle and the Wardens of the Soul,” pp.
            20–36). Sajavaara discusses the allegory of the Castle of Love at length (pp. 90–101).

              lawe iset</hi>. The dichotomy in these lines is between natural law (innate moral
            feeling, arrived at through reason) and positive law (a law, whether divine or human,
            that is created and imposed). Romans 2:14–16 offers support for the idea of natural law:
            “For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the
            law; these having not the law are a law to themselves: Who shew the work of the law
            written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts
            between themselves accusing, or also defending one another, in the day when God shall
            judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.” Grosseteste discusses
            natural and positive laws in detail in <hi rend="italic">On</hi><hi rend="italic"> the
              Cessation of the Laws</hi> (trans. Hildebrand; see especially 1.4–1.6, pp. 45–49).
            Grosseteste defines natural law as “actions that are intrinsically just,” where “every
            rational creature, when it is considered in the state of its first creation uncorrupted
            by sin . . . could, by a movement of right reason uncorrupted, know the whole natural
            law, inscribe it immediately on its own mind by reasoning without labor or delay, and
            retain it inscribed on the tables of the heart without forgetfulness”; in contrast,
            positive law, “the law of deeds,” is one that must “be dictated to the rational creature
            from the outside, for it could not know in matters that are indifferent what its Creator
            wants it to do unless he tells it” (<hi rend="italic">Cessation of the Laws</hi>, trans.
            Hildebrand, p. 45). Grosseteste sees positive laws commanded by God as necessary, since
            “the fullest and most humble obedience consists in observing the law of deeds, or the
            positive law” (p. 47). In fact, Grosseteste holds that it is possible to act with
            perfect obedience only through the addition of positive law precisely because it cannot
            be arrived at rationally: “the rationality of testing and achieving perfect obedience
            consists in the observance of indifferent mandates that of themselves lack rationality”
            (p. 48). One such mandate is that mentioned in lines 174–76 of <hi rend="italic"
              >The</hi><hi rend="italic"> Castle of Love</hi>: <hi rend="italic">“Of the appel yow
              never ne </hi><hi rend="italic">et, / Of the tre that is forbode,” / So He seide</hi>
            (see explanatory note to lines 174–78, below). For an in-depth examination of the topic
            of natural law, see the edited collection by Jacobs, <hi rend="italic">Reason, Religion,
              and Natural Law</hi>, particularly the sections on medieval Jewish philosophy (pp.
            81–129) and medieval Christian philosophy (pp. 131–97). For contextualization of
            Grosseteste’s <hi rend="italic">On </hi><hi rend="italic">the Cessation of the
            Laws</hi>, including other related works, his probable audience, and an outline of the
            work, see Hildebrand’s introduction to the translation (pp. 3–24). Hoskin discusses

            saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat: But of the tree of knowledge of good
            and evil, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt
            die the death.” Grosseteste explains, “the Lord gave him [i.e., man] a positive law . .
            . namely, that he not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which was in
            the middle of paradise” (<hi rend="italic">Cessation of the Laws</hi>, trans.

            evil.</p><p style="enote-indent">The biblical story in Genesis does not identify the
            fruit growing on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Some early traditions
            favored the fig as the forbidden fruit, on the assumption that the fruit came from the
            same tree as the one from which Adam and Eve took leaves to cover their nakedness
            (Jager, <hi rend="italic">Tempter’s Voice</hi>, p. 67). See Genesis 3:7: “And the eyes
            of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed
            together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.” Michelangelo, for example, depicted
            the fruit as a fig in the Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco. <hi rend="italic">Genesis
              Rabba</hi>, a collection of rabbinic commentary on Genesis, reports a debate among
            rabbis who variously identify the fruit as grape, wheat, citron, and fig (Shoulson,
            “Embrace of the Fig Tree,” p. 885). (<hi rend="italic">Genesis Rabba</hi> is the oldest
            extant collection, dating from the late fourth to early fifth centuries [Menn, <hi
              rend="italic">Judah and Tamar</hi>, pp. 287–88]).</p>
          <p style="enote-indent">In ME the word <hi rend="italic">appel</hi> (line 174) can refer,
            as in Modern English, to an apple (see <hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
              >appel, -il, -ul</hi> [n.], sense 2), but <hi rend="italic">appel</hi> also meant
            “[a]ny kind of fruit growing on a tree, shrub, or vine, such as an apple, crab apple,
            pear, peach, citron, banana, haw, berry, cucumber; also, a nut, a tuber” (<hi
              rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">appel, -il, -ul</hi> [n.], sense 1a).
            Nevertheless, by the medieval period, the apple was the standard fruit visually (Jager,
              <hi rend="italic">Tempter’s Voice</hi>, p. 67). Written narratives, whether Latin or
            vernacular, including the vernacular Bible, likewise identified the apple (Murdoch, <hi
              rend="italic">Adam’s Grace</hi>, pp. 16–18). The overlap of the Latin words for
            “apple” (<hi rend="italic">mālum</hi>) and “evil” (<hi rend="italic">mălum</hi>) invited
            medieval wordplay on the two meanings (Jager, <hi rend="italic">Tempter’s Voice</hi>, p.
            182; Murdoch, <hi rend="italic">Adam’s Grace</hi>, p. 16) and may have contributed to
            the long-term identification of the apple as the fruit in question.</p>

            here as a loss of inheritance: Adam had the <hi rend="italic">seisyn</hi> (line 185), or
            “seisin,” which refers to “possession in freehold, freq. indicated or established by
            actual or physical possession” (<hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
              >seisine</hi>, sense 1a), and then <hi rend="italic">hit forles</hi> [forfeited it]

            similar feudal and legal structures, especially as related to the household, to inform

            Compare John 10:30, where Jesus says, “I and the Father are one”; and John 14:9, “Jesus
            saith to him: Have I been so long a time with you; and have you not known me? Philip, he
            that seeth me seeth the Father also.” See also John 1:1–2. The idea of the Father and
            Son having “one substance” (compare “une sustance” from line 212 of the AN poem) is
            expressed in the Nicene Creed: “Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only-begotten of
            his Father, of the substance of the Father, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very
            God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father” (Percival, ed. and
            trans., “The Nicene Creed”). In arriving at this statement, “the First Nicean Council
            borrowed Origen’s term <hi rend="italic">homoousios</hi>, that is ‘of the same
            substance,’ to underscore the truly divine nature of the Son,” but dispute over the term
            continued even after the Council, because “some asked if ‘of the same substance’ or ‘one
            in being’ referred to a numerical sameness or oneness or a generic similarity” (S.
            Brown, “Trinity,” 2:1339). Compare the AN text:</p><quote type="columns">

            process of creation. The idea that God the Father created everything through the Son
            (i.e., Jesus) is supported by numerous New Testament passages. See, for example, John
            1:3, “All things were made by [i.e., through] him [i.e., the Son]: and without him was
            made nothing that was made”; Hebrews 1:1–2, “God . . . [i]n these days hath spoken to us
            by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world”;
            and Colossians 1:15–16, “[the Son] is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of
            every creature: For in him were all things created in heaven and on earth, visible and
            invisible, whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or powers: all things
            were created by him and in him.” See also John 1:10, 1 Corinthians 8:6, and Romans
            11:36. Compare lines 213–16 of the AN poem, which describes the process a little
            differently. For a more detailed discussion of the theological implications, see
            explanatory note to lines 559–60, below. The narrator also reiterates the idea in lines

            significant section of the text (lines 275–520) and was a popular element. The idea of
            the Four Daughters is an elaboration of Psalm 84:11: “Mercy and truth have met each
            other: justice and peace have kissed” (see Sajavaara, p. 63; Boulton, p. 65n25). Traver

            style="enote-indent">This idea became part of the Nicene Creed. Intended to combat early
            heresies that doubted Christ’s double nature as both fully man and fully God, the Nicene
            Creed was adopted in 325 CE at the First Council of Nicaea and revised in 381 at the
            Council of Constantinople, though the principal concepts are significantly older (G.
            Evans, <hi rend="italic">Brief History of Heresy</hi>, pp. 29–30). The Arian heresy
            (from Arius) was one that both denied the Trinity and held that Jesus “was the first and
            highest of all created beings” but nevertheless a creation, who was neither divine nor
            fully human because “Jesus had a human body but not a human soul” (Boer, <hi

            The Apollinarian heresy (from Apollinaris), which similarly denied Jesus’s human nature,
            nevertheless affirmed his divinity; Apollinarianism was condemned by the Council of
            Constantinople in 381 (Boer, <hi rend="italic">Short History of the Early Church</hi>,

            life, death, and Resurrection: Abraham, Moses, Jonah, Habakkuk, Elijah, Daniel,
            Jeremiah, David, Isaiah, Elisha, and Samuel. Daniel was believed to have prophesied
            Christ’s birth, as well as the end times, including the Antichrist and Christ’s

            interpreted as “types” or “forerunners” of Christ, particularly Moses and Jonah.
            Beginning with the New Testament, Christian tradition sees Moses as prefiguring Christ

            The description of the castle is highly symbolic, even as it makes use of specific and
            real architectural features. “Bailey” can refer either to the wall surrounding a castle
            or keep, or to the courtyard within the wall (see <hi rend="italic">MW</hi>, <hi
              rend="italic">bailey</hi> [n.]). The meaning in this case is “[t]he wall surrounding a
            castle or fortified city” (<hi rend="italic">MED</hi>, <hi rend="italic">baille</hi>
            [n.2], sense 1a). Here there are three baileys, one inside the other, for added
            protection, which Whitehead explains symbolize “virginity, chastity, and matrimony” (<hi
              rend="italic">Castles of </hi><hi rend="italic">the Mind</hi>, p. 94) and Wheatley
            likewise identifies as “the Virgin’s concentric virtues of maidenhood, chastity and holy

            may tell nor heart think of something is a proverbial exaggeration occurring widely in
            both secular and religious writings. For example, in The Merchant’s Tale, Chaucer’s
            Merchant avows that he cannot speak of the “blisse” between husband and wife, for
            “[t]her may no tongue telle, or herte thynke” (<hi rend="italic">CT</hi> IV[E]1340–41).
            Chaucer’s Parson uses almost the same phrase in his discussion of virginity: “she hath
            in hire that tonge may nat telle ne herte thynke” (<hi rend="italic">CT</hi> X[I]949).
            Boulton identifies it as “an inexpressibility formula based on 1 Cor[inthians] 2:9” (p.
            80n113). The passage in the AN text is “De biauté i ad plus asez / Ke lange ne put
            descrire, / Quer penser, ne bouche dire” [Of beauty it has much more / Than tongue can

            and beautifully constructed.” Whereas the English poem describes the battlements with a

            tradition (discussed in explanatory note to line 123, above) and the metaphor of Mary’s
            heart as a rose. In a sermon on the Assumption of Mary, early thirteenth-century
            troubadour-turned-Cistercian-monk Hélinand of Froidmont describes Mary’s heart as a
            rose, whose “delicate whiteness near the roots of the rose’s leaves is the perpetual
            purity of the Virgin Mary’s heart,” explaining that “from the roots of the leaves [her

            without, as well as guarding it always perfectly whole” (Hélinand of Froidmont, quoted

              bodi</hi>. Mary’s body was considered the source of Jesus’s human nature, and the
            Virgin Birth was thought to have kept Jesus from inheriting original sin (Izbicki,
            “Immaculate Conception,” p. 396). The reference to Mary as the <hi rend="italic"
              >Mayden</hi> (Virgin) alludes to the belief that she remained a virgin through “divine
            intervention [whereby] Jesus was conceived not by man but by the power of the Holy
            Spirit” (Logan, <hi rend="italic">History of the Church </hi><hi rend="italic">in the
              Middle Ages</hi>, p. 136). The doctrine of the Virgin Birth is based on the story of
            Jesus’s conception in the Gospels of Matthew (1:18–21) and Luke (1:26–35). As the
            doctrine developed, theologians came to agree that Mary’s virginity remained intact even
            after childbirth, an idea supported by apocryphal stories about Mary’s life, including
            “the independent testimony of the midwife that after the birth of Christ Mary remained
              <hi rend="italic">virgo intacta</hi>” (Collette, “Chaucer’s Discourse of Mariology,”
            p. 130). Some theologians, including Ambrose, Augustine, and Gregory the Great, went
            even further, asserting “that Mary remained a virgin through the delivery of her son,
            which was effected ‘without opening the uterus,’ according to Gregory the Great”
            (Klapisch-Zuber, <hi rend="italic">History of Women in the West</hi>, p. 26). Despite
            such definitive claims, the subject of Mary’s bodily integrity during the process of
            childbirth remained a subject of discussion and debate in the Middle Ages. For a
            detailed cultural history of Mary’s status as virgin, see Warner, <hi rend="italic"
              >Alone of </hi><hi rend="italic">All Her Sex</hi>. Boklund-Lagopoulou points out that
            religious lyrics conceptualize Mary’s body “in multiple metaphors, derived from
            centuries of patristic biblical hermeneutics,” and explains that whereas “many of the
            poems to the Virgin make use of the language of courtly love, they never catalogue the
            beauties of Mary’s body” (“<hi rend="italic">Yate of Heven</hi>,” p. 139). For details

            in subsequent lines are identified as those that counter the seven deadly sins. Boulton
            points out the symbolic nature of the number of barbicans, given that

            countered by seven opposing virtues, though normally sloth would be countered by
            diligence, not spiritual joy (Boulton, p. 73n72). Where the English poem has <hi

            Christians saw the passage as a foreshadowing of Christ; in medieval Christian exegesis,

            The metaphor of the sun overshadowing Mary and exalting her refers to God’s power
            (through the Holy Spirit) overshadowing Mary at Christ’s conception and alludes to part
            of the Annunciation in Luke 1:35: “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of
            the Most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of
            thee shall be called the Son of God.” Compare the Wycliffite Bible’s translation of Luke
            1:35: “The Hooly Goost schal come fro aboue in to thee, and the vertu of the Hiyeste
            schal ouerschadewe thee; and therfor that hooli thing that schal be borun of thee, schal
            be clepid the sone of God” (Wycliffe, “John Wycliffe Bible”). The Annunciation refers to
            the event where the archangel Gabriel comes to Mary and announces that she will bear the

              rend="italic">The Romance of the Rose</hi>] by Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun,
            where the attempt on virginity is represented as an assault on a castle. Whitehead
            outlines the two competing versions of the besieged castle in medieval literature: “the

            legal argumentation. The encounter alludes to the biblical account of Christ’s
            temptation in the wilderness, detailed in the Gospels of Matthew (4:1–11) and Luke
            (4:1–13) and mentioned in Mark (1:12–13). Marx includes a detailed discussion of the
            scene and its theological complexity in relation to the idea of the Devil’s rights
            theory of Christ’s redemption of humanity, which argued that “God was under an
            obligation to respect the Devil’s right to possess humanity and that humanity could be
            freed and reconciled to God only if the Devil abused his power, which he did by killing
            the sinless Christ” (<hi rend="italic">Devil’s Rights and the Redemption</hi>, p. 1; see

            outright responsible for Christ’s crucifixion, reflects a common component of
            antisemitism present as early as the Gospel of Matthew (J. Edwards, “The Church and the
            Jews,” p. 88). The Jews were expelled from England in 1290, thus when the ME <hi
              rend="italic">Castle of </hi><hi rend="italic">Love</hi> was written, Jews were no
            longer an active presence in English communities. During Grosseteste’s lifetime,
            however, there were still Jews living in Britain, including in Leicester, where
            Grosseteste was archdeacon until 1232, the year the earl of Leicester Simon de Montfort
            had the Jews permanently expelled (Goering, “Grosseteste and the Jews of Leicester,” p.
            182). Grosseteste’s views on Jews are outlined in his Letter 5, addressed to Margaret,
            countess of Winchester, Montfort’s great-aunt, who gave the Jews of Leicester sanctuary
            after Montfort expelled them (Watt, “Grosseteste and the Jews,” p. 201). Letter 5
            denounced the countess’s actions, and Southern proposes that Grosseteste might have
            instigated the Leicester removal (p. 246). For further discussion, see Goering, “Robert
            Grosseteste and the Jews of Leicester,” and Watt, “Grosseteste and the Jews.” For an
            edition of Letter 5, see Grosseteste, “Epistola Quinta,” ed. Luard; for a translation,

            Medieval tradition held that the name of the Roman soldier who pierced Jesus’s side on
            the Cross was Longinus of Caesarea, though he is not named in the Gospel account (John
            19:34). “Longinus” was also conflated with the centurion who avowed with others at the
            Crucifixion, “Indeed this was the Son of God” (Matthew 27:54), and on this basis was
            thought to have converted to Christianity. The first example of the soldier’s name
            occurs in an illumination in a late-sixth-century manuscript (ca. 586), where the name
            is written above the soldier piercing Jesus’s side (D. Jeffrey, “Longinus,” <hi
              rend="italic">DBTEL</hi>, p. 461). The name also appears in the apocryphal Gospel of
            Nicodemus, referring to both the soldier with the spear and the centurion who testified
            (Peebles, <hi rend="italic">Legend</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Longinus</hi>, pp. 7–8).
            According to some medieval traditions, Longinus was the blind dupe of Christ’s actual
            tormentors, as in the stage directions of a Corpus Christi play where, after piercing
            Jesus’s side, Longinus rubs the blood on his eyes and his sight is restored, signifying
            his salvation (Kolve, <hi rend="italic">Play Called Corpus Christi</hi>, p.
          219).</p></note>

            into the Nicene Creed beginning in 589 at the Third Synod of Toledo, causing a major

              Christianity</hi>, p. 521). Augustine, writing in the century before that, supported
            the idea, though he maintained a more significant role for the Father than the Son in
            describing the Holy Spirit’s procession (Dunham, <hi rend="italic">Trinity and Creation

            clarity, and beauty.</p><p style="enote-indent">It is no accident that the description
            of heaven in <hi rend="italic">The Castle of Love</hi> emphasizes brightness, clarity,
            and light, since light was fundamentally connected to Grosseteste’s understanding of the
            nature of God and key to his concept of the Trinity (McEvoy, <hi rend="italic">Robert
              Grosseteste</hi>, p. 93). Panti explains that for Grosseteste “light . . . is not at
            all something to be signified for its intrinsic physical ‘value,’ such as its being
            form, or energy or <hi rend="italic">species</hi> or whatever else it is and does in the
            natural world, but something which <hi rend="italic">has</hi> an intrinsic symbolic
            value, given that it is the best physical substance to represent God’s essence and
            action” (“Robert Grosseteste’s Cosmology of Light,” p. 74; italics in original). The
            vision of heaven in <hi rend="italic">The Castle </hi><hi rend="italic">of Love</hi>
            does not focus solely on light, however, but also emphasizes beauty. Concepts of beauty
            in the medieval period relied on both proportion and light. Grosseteste’s interest in
            beauty privileged “the aesthetics of light” over those of proportion (McEvoy, <hi
              rend="italic">Robert Grosseteste</hi>, p. 95). For more on medieval theories of
            beauty, see Umberto Eco, <hi rend="italic">Art and Beauty in the </hi><hi rend="italic"
              >Middle Ages</hi> (trans. Bredin), who includes chapters on “The Aesthetics of
            Proportion” and “The Aesthetics of Light” (pp. 28–42 and 43–51, respectively). See also
            explanatory note to line 1757, below.</p>
          <p style="enote-indent">Of interest in relation to the description of heaven in <hi
              rend="italic">The Castle of Love</hi> is Grosseteste’s Letter 6, where he describes to
            Richard Marshall, earl of Pembroke, what he imagines heaven will be like (<hi
              rend="italic">Letters</hi>, trans. Mantello and Goering, pp. 71–72; Boulton suggests
            the connection [p. 88n156]). Grosseteste begins his description of “the heavenly abode”
            in his letter by explaining that “the most precious thing will be a light combined with
            no shadows, interrupted by no changes, restricted by no boundaries, and defined by no
            limits” (<hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, p. 71). Light is also connected to good: “there
            will be the fullest possible possession of each and every good, as when several eyes
            look upon every part of the sun without its being divided up for them” (<hi
              rend="italic">Letters</hi>, p. 72). In addition, light is linked to both God and
            truth: “In heaven our spirits will possess a knowledge of all truth without any
            ignorance, for in the light that is God we shall see the light of every creature of
            truth, just as the Psalmist says: <hi rend="italic">In your light we shall</hi><hi
              rend="italic"> see light</hi> [Ps 35:10]” (<hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, p. 72;

          <p style="enote-indent">Visions of heaven and hell, such as appear at the end of <hi
              rend="italic">The Castle of Love</hi>, are common in medieval literature. The early
              <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> (before 1200), for example, devotes more than half
            its lines to descriptions of hell and heaven (see Fein’s edition; for date, see ed. and
            trans. Fein, <hi rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi>, p. 344). Although the narrator of <hi
              rend="italic">Poema Morale</hi> is careful to note that he has not been to hell and
            therefore knows nothing about it firsthand (line 143), the genre encompasses not only
            descriptions based on imagination but also “an extraordinarily popular literary genre”
            of works that “purport to describe actual visions of the realm entered by souls after
            death” (Gardiner, <hi rend="italic">Medieval Visions </hi><hi rend="italic">of Heaven
              and Hell</hi>, p. xv). Although focused on these alleged actual visions, Gardiner’s
            introduction to <hi rend="italic">Medieval Visions of </hi><hi rend="italic">Heaven and
              Hell</hi> is nevertheless useful for an overview of the development, types,
            characteristics, and tropes of medieval descriptions of the afterlife, especially given
            the strong impact of this visionary literature on medieval literature of all kinds. For
            further analysis of medieval visions of heaven and hell, see Pollard’s edited volume,
              <hi rend="italic">Imagining the Medieval Afterlife</hi>, which contains a useful

          <p style="enote-noindent"><space rend="indent1"/>The idea of seeing clearly in line 1750
            may allude to 1 Corinthians 13:12, “We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but
            then face to face. Now I know in part; but then I shall know even as I am known.” The
            final lines of the AN poem illustrate the literary convention of ending a devotional
            work with a prayer. The shortened version of the ME poem that appears in the V and A MSS
            likewise ends with a prayer, which echoes the lines from the AN poem. In V and A, the
            lines begin with a fairly close paraphrase of lines 1757–60 of the AN poem and then move
            to a much looser and incomplete rendition of some of the ideas in lines 1749–56 (for
            example, in V and A the appended prayer does not mention the theological concept of the
            Trinity). For a transcription of the final lines in V and A, see the textual note to
